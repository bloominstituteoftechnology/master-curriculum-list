                <p>The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by
                    step. It's particularly useful when you need to create an object with many possible configurations.

                <h2>Builder Pattern</h2>
                <p>Today we're going to introduce our first example of a design pattern called the Builder pattern.
                    Before diving into the Builder pattern, it would be helpful to understand what design patterns are.
                    Once we cover design patterns at a high level, we will address the Builder pattern conceptually and
                    in code.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>What are Design Patterns?</h3>
                    <p>Design patterns are strategies for solving everyday problems found when coding. These patterns
                        are considered best practices and create a set of terms that developers can use to convey how
                        things may be solved. These design patterns can solve a host of problems, such as notifying
                        numerous classes of an event (Observer), ensuring only one instance of a class exists
                        (Singleton), or allowing two incompatible objects to work together (Adapter).</p>

                    <p>By utilizing design patterns, we follow a set of conventions with which other developers are
                        familiar, quickly communicating how the code works. When developers first look at new code with
                        a pattern implemented, they can more easily see how to interact with the code and be more
                        productive. (You will experience this in future projects when given unfamiliar code that uses
                        the Builder pattern.)</p>

                    <p>One last thing on design patterns: use good judgment when deciding to use a design pattern. Just
                        because the problem is present doesn't necessarily mean a design pattern will fix it. With time
                        and experience, one will start to see when to implement a design pattern and when not to.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>What is the Builder Pattern?</h3>
                    <p>Now that we've covered the concept of design patterns, let's learn about what the Builder pattern
                        is and what problems it solves.</p>

                    <p>At its core, the Builder pattern lets us build objects with lots of variables. Classes with lots
                        of variables can have constructors with lots of parameters, but those constructors can be
                        difficult to use and decipher (was the 14th parameter a boolean for isActive or isDeleted?).
                        Often times there are many non-required parameters as well that just make the constructor more
                        verbose and confusing.</p>

                    <p>Let's take the TacoSalad constructor as an example of a long constructor that we want to fix:</p>

                    <pre><code>public TacoSalad(Tortilla tortilla, Lettuce lettuce, Meat meat, Rice rice, Beans beans, Dressing dressing, Pico pico, TortillaChips tortillaChips, Guacamole guacamole, boolean isGuacOnTheSide, SourCream sourCream, boolean isSourCreamOnTheSide, Lime lime)</code></pre>

                    <p>This constructor has a long list of parameters that we must carefully input. Ideally, we would
                        like to work less, not more, when constructing objects. Before we jump into how we will fix
                        this, take a moment to think about how you might make a TacoSalad object without using this long
                        constructor.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
                    <p>One of the great things about coding is that many solutions exist for a given problem, and it is
                        up to us to decide how we will solve it. So with this issue of the long constructor, we could
                        consider using a constructor with no parameters and utilizing the setters for only the items we
                        would like to include (e.g., setTortilla(flourTortilla)). This works, but what if a taco salad
                        has a set of required ingredients, or what if we want the object to be immutable (i.e. have no
                        setters)?</p>

                    <p>Another solution might be to make a few constructors that require certain fields. For example,
                        you might have:</p>

                    <pre><code>public TacoSalad(Tortilla tortilla, Lettuce lettuce)
public TacoSalad(Tortilla tortilla, Lettuce lettuce, Meat meat)
public TacoSalad(Tortilla tortilla, Lettuce lettuce, Meat meat, Rice rice)
public TacoSalad(Tortilla tortilla, Lettuce lettuce, Meat meat, Rice rice, Beans beans)
//...and so on...</code></pre>

                    <p>This solution works too, but then we fill our class up with a bunch of extra constructors. If it
                        is one or two constructors, that would be manageable, but if we get many more, we will be
                        managing a host of constructors over time. Having so many constructors can be painful if we
                        decide later to add onions as an ingredient and we now have to update a bunch of constructors to
                        include onions. The pain of managing this class can be frustrating to say the least</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Show Me the Pattern!</h3>
                    <p>The Builder pattern can help us here in a few simple steps. First, we create a builder class that
                        will build our class for us and validates the required fields. In most cases, the builder class
                        is placed inside the class we want to build (we show you how this is done below). The builder
                        then has a list of methods that allow setting any parameters individually. Finally, when the
                        class instance is ready to be built, the builder class has a build method that combines all of
                        the given parameters into one object and returns it.</p>

                    <p>Let's look at an example of what this might look like in code:</p>

                    <pre><code>public class TacoSalad {
    
    private Tortilla tortilla;
    private Lettuce lettuce;
    //...the rest of the fields

    public TacoSalad(Tortilla tortilla, Lettuce lettuce, Meat meat, Rice rice, Beans beans, Dressing dressing, Pico pico, TortillaChips tortillaChips, Guacamole guacamole, boolean isGuacOnTheSide, SourCream sourCream, boolean isSourCreamOnTheSide, Lime lime) {
        //sets all the parameters to their respective fields
    }
    
    // #1
    public class Builder {

        // #2
        private Tortilla tortilla;
        private Lettuce lettuce;
        //...the rest of the fields

        // #2
        public Builder withTortilla(Tortilla tortilla) {
            this.tortilla = tortilla;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder withLettuce(Lettuce lettuce) {
            this.lettuce = lettuce;
            return this;
        }

        //...the rest of the parameter setters

        // #3
        public TacoSalad build() {
            if (tortilla == null || lettuce == null) {
                throw new RuntimeException("TacoSalads must have a tortilla and lettuce")
            }
            return new TacoSalad(tortilla, lettuce, mean, rice, beans, dressing, pico, tortillaChips, guacamole, isGuacOnTheSide, sourCream, isSourCreamOnTheSide, lime);
        }
    }

}</code></pre>

                    <p>Let's go over a few parts highlighted by numbers in this code:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The builder class is inside of the TacoSalad class. Having it inside the class allows our
                            code to be verbose and helps developers more easily find the class (you will see an example
                            of this when we use the builder class below). This is the most common place for a builder
                            class to be.</li>
                        <li>The builder has methods to store each constructor's parameters in its fields. Notice that we
                            have not made a TacoSalad object yet; instead, we have merely stored the values. Pause here
                            for a moment and look closely at each method, particularly the return type. What are we
                            returning? It is the builder itself! And for good reason. Returning the builder allows us to
                            chain the commands together—more on that in a bit.</li>
                        <li>The build method is where we create the object using our collected parameters. With the
                            object created, we return the object, and our builder is done.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Now, this may look like a lot of code, and in some ways, it is. However, when it comes to using
                        the builder, we will see that we save ourselves time in creating new objects with the builder
                        and maintaining the construction of our class by limiting the number of changes required to
                        update it.</p>

                    <p>Let's see what it looks like to build a TacoSalad using it's Builder class:</p>

                    <pre><code>TacoSalad.Builder builder = new TacoSalad.Builder();
builder.withLettuce(romainLettuce);
builder.withTortilla(flourTortilla);
builder.withBeans(blackBeans);
builder.withMeat(chicken);
builder.withGuac(guac);
builder.withGuacOnTheSide(true);

TacoSalad salad = builder.build();</code></pre>

                    <p>We have eliminated the need for the TacoSalad constructor and replaced it with the builder. We do
                        not have a long constructor to deal with, and we can easily see each passed-in item. But we can
                        make it more succinct by leveraging the fact that each with... method returns the builder. Let
                        us now chain those commands and see what it looks like:</p>

                    <pre><code>TacoSalad tacoSalad = new TacoSalad.Builder()
            .withLettuce(romainLettuce)
            .withTortilla(flourTortilla)
            .withBeans(blackBeans)
            .withMeat(chicken)
            .withGuac(guac)
            .withGuacOnTheSide(true)
            .build();</code></pre>

                    <p>Now that looks like a good builder pattern (and a decent taco salad, if I do say so myself). We
                        have successfully altered the construction of an object with a long list of parameters into a
                        very readable and straightforward process.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Maintaining the Builder Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The process is also straightforward when it comes to maintaining the Builder pattern. Let us say
                        the manager tells us we need to add jalapeños to the TacoSalad constructor. If we still had the
                        multiple long constructors, we would have to update nearly all of them to include jalapeños.
                        With the Builder pattern, this change is as simple as adding the jalapeño object to the one
                        constructor and adding one more method to our builder pattern. It would look something like
                        this:</p>

                    <pre><code>public class TacoSalad {
    
    //...the rest of the fields
    private Jalapeños jalapeños;

    public TacoSalad(Tortilla tortilla, Lettuce lettuce, ..., Jalapeños jalapeños) {
        //sets all the parameters to their respective fields
    }

    public class Builder {

        //...

        private Jalapeños jalapeños;

        //...

        public Builder withJalapeños(Jalapeños jalapeños) {
            this.jalapeños = jalapeños;
            return this;
        }

        //...
    }

}</code></pre>

                    <p>Not very much work to include a new ingredient and it seamlessly integrates with the rest of our
                        code. The Builder pattern is doing its job nicely.</p>

                    <p>The Builder pattern is just one of many design patterns we will learn about in this course, but
                        it is perhaps one of the more common patterns used within Java development. One final note is
                        that there are variations in implementing the Builder pattern (as well as any other pattern).
                        These variations are ok. Design patterns are more like guidelines, not rules. As we continue to
                        discuss the Builder pattern in this module, we have slightly altered the implementation to show
                        what these variations look like.</p>

                    <p>If you still have questions about the Builder pattern, feel free to search the Hub, attend the
                        Code-along, or set up a one-on-one with a learner's assistant. A quick google search on the
                        Builder pattern will also reveal a host of examples.</p>

                <h2>Builder Pattern Explained</h2>
                <p>The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by
                    step. It's particularly useful when constructing objects with many parameters, some of which may be
                    optional.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Problem It Solves</h3>
                    <p>Classes with many fields can have constructors with numerous parameters, making them difficult to
                        use and read. Consider this example:</p>
                    <pre><code>public TacoSalad(Tortilla tortilla, Lettuce lettuce, Meat meat, Rice rice, 
    Beans beans, Dressing dressing, Pico pico, TortillaChips tortillaChips, 
    Guacamole guacamole, boolean isGuacOnTheSide, SourCream sourCream, 
    boolean isSourCreamOnTheSide, Lime lime)</code></pre>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Builder Solution</h3>
                    <p>The Builder pattern creates a separate builder class that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Has methods to set each field individually</li>
                        <li>Returns the builder itself for method chaining</li>
                        <li>Provides a build() method that validates and creates the object</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Code Example</h3>
                    <pre><code>TacoSalad tacoSalad = new TacoSalad.Builder()
    .withLettuce(romainLettuce)
    .withTortilla(flourTortilla)
    .withBeans(blackBeans)
    .withMeat(chicken)
    .withGuac(guac)
    .withGuacOnTheSide(true)
    .build();</code></pre>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More readable code through method chaining</li>
                        <li>No need to remember parameter order</li>
                        <li>Can enforce validation rules in the build() method</li>
                        <li>Makes complex object creation more maintainable</li>
                        <li>Flexibility to set only the parameters you need</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Setup Sprint 4 Challenge Repo</h2>
                <p>This Sprint culminates in a Sprint Challenge project. You should begin by forking and cloning the
                    Sprint Challenge starter repo:</p>

                <div class="content-section">

                </div>

                <p>This will be your project repo for Sprint 4.</p>

                <p>This resource is also visible under the Sprint Challenge section of the course page. After each
                    module, you will be assigned a mastery task with instructions on adding to or modifying the starter
                    code for the challenge.</p>

                <p>Upon completion of all mastery tasks, the Sprint Challenge project will be complete and ready for you
                    to submit to CodeGrade. The CodeGrade submission page is available under the Sprint Challenge
                    section on the modules page.</p>

                <h3>Mastery Task Guidelines</h3>
                <p>Mastery Tasks are opportunities to test your knowledge and understanding through code. When a mastery
                    task is shown in a module, it means that we've covered all the concepts that you need to complete
                    that task.</p>
                <p>Each mastery task must pass 100% of the automated tests and code styling checks to pass each sprint.
                    Your code must be your own. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out for support.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <p>We've been using a single full-sized constructor to initiate our Models. This worked fine at first,
                    but as the Employee class grew and the number of optional fields increased, we needed a better
                    solution. We've decided for this and for future projects that we will be implementing the Builder
                    Pattern for object instantiation.</p>

                <h3>Implement the Builder Pattern</h3>
                <p>Refactor the Company and Employee class so that they each have no public constructors, and so that
                    each can be instantiated using an internally defined Builder class.</p>

                <h3>Validate the Employee Objects</h3>
                <p>When an Employee object is built, it should first check that the firstname and the company are not
                    null. If they are we need to alert the user somehow and stop execution of the build method. To do so
                    we will throw a generic RuntimeException with a message informing the user that these fields are
                    required.</p>

                <h3>Completion</h3>
                <p>Run the gradle command:</p>
                <pre><code>./gradlew -q clean :test --tests 'com.bloomtech.welcomeletter.MasteryTask_1*'</code></pre>
                <p>and ensure all tests pass.</p>
