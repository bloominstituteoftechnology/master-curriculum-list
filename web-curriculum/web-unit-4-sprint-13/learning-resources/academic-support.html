                    <p><strong>BloomTech recognizes the importance of providing additional resources to help you get
                            unblocked and get support to understand particular concepts. Before seeking additional
                            support, we encourage you to attend any of our live event sessions first. If you are still
                            blocked, BloomTech offers several support options.</strong></p>

                <h2>Live Chat</h2>
                <p>At BloomTech, we're committed to providing you with the support and resources you need to succeed.
                    That's why we've made it easy for you to connect with our knowledgeable Learner Assistants through
                    <strong>live chat</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can access <strong>live chat</strong> with a Learner Assistant directly within the course,
                        allowing you to quickly and easily get the support you need while studying.</li>
                    <li>In addition, you can also connect with a Learner Assistant through the BloomTech Portal, which
                        serves as a central hub for all of your learning resources and tools.</li>
                    <li>And if you're ever in need of assistance beyond the course or the portal, our Help Hub is always
                        available to connect you with a Learner Assistant who can help address your concerns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With so many options for accessing support, you can feel confident that you'll always have the help
                    you need, when you need it.</p>

                <h2>Learner Assistant Unblocking Session</h2>
                <p>We offer <strong>academic support sessions</strong> with our Learner Assistants as a last resort when
                    you have exhausted all other available resources. We are delighted to provide this service to you
                    when you require it. It's important to note, however, that to ensure that everyone has the
                    opportunity to benefit from this valuable resource, we limit learners to <strong>one (1) session per
                        week</strong>. This allows us to serve as many learners as possible and ensures that our Learner
                    Assistants have the time to devote to each session.</p>
                <p>While Learner Assistants are available to aid you in overcoming obstacles, they should not serve as a
                    replacement for the instructor or live events. If you're unable to find a live event that suits your
                    availability, please reach out by submitting a support ticket. We'll make every effort to
                    accommodate your needs.</p>
