                <h2>Module Overview</h2>
                <p>In this module, you'll learn comprehensive testing strategies for Java applications. You'll understand how to write effective unit tests, implement integration tests, and apply test-driven development principles to improve code quality and reliability.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement comprehensive testing strategies using JUnit and Mockito</li>
                    <li>Write clear, focused test cases following the GIVEN-WHEN-THEN pattern</li>
                    <li>Create deterministic tests that verify functionality and catch edge cases</li>
                    <li>Apply test-driven development to guide implementation</li>
                    <li>Use mocks and stubs to isolate components for testing</li>
                    <li>Design integration tests that verify system behavior end-to-end</li>

                    <h3>Mastery Task Guidelines</h3>
                    <p>Mastery Tasks are opportunities to test your knowledge and understanding through code. When a mastery task is shown in a module, it means that we've covered all the concepts that you need to complete that task. You will want to make sure you finish them by the end of the week to stay on track and complete the unit.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each mastery task must pass 100% of the automated tests and code styling checks to pass each unit. Your code must be your own. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out for support.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-section">
                    <p>In Milestone 1, you added a FIXME into your code where you believe a bug needs to be fixed. Now you will fix the bug using a process that ensures the same bug won't reappear in the future. You will first write a unit test that will cause the error message related to the bug. Then you will fix the bug and use your new unit test to ensure the bug is properly fixed. Before jumping into the next milestone, read this brief refresher from Milestone 1 of the problem:</p>
                    
                    <p>A CS representative has filed a bug report, stating that when they request the promise history for order ID 111-749023-7630574, the Missed Promise CLI prints a weird message and exits:</p>
                    
                    <pre><code>Running CLI! Please enter the orderId you would like to view the Promise History for.
> 111-749023-7630574
Error encountered. Exiting.
Thank you for using the Promise History CLI. Have a great day!</code></pre>
                    
                    <h3>Milestone 2: Be Kind to "Future You"</h3>
                    <p>Write a unit test (with a descriptive name!) that fails whenever the bug is triggered. If "Future You" accidentally re-introduces this bug, the unit test will fail and you'll know you have to fix something before you can submit it for a code review.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Which order IDs should I use in my tests?</h4>
                    <p>You could try a bunch of different order IDs until you find an order that's suitable for your test. However, most order IDs are not guaranteed to be consistent, and therefore aren't suitable for testing.</p>
                    
                    <p>To get a list of orders that are guaranteed to never change, run <code>java -jar cli.jar --show-fixtures</code>. This prints the known consistent orders, along with a description of their attributes, before proceeding to the CLI.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Milestone 3: Grace Hopper That Bug</h3>
                    <p>Fix the bug! Then run your code and verify that your new unit test passes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Milestone 4: Commit It</h3>
                    <pre><code>./gradlew -q clean :test

./gradlew -q clean IRT

./gradlew -q clean MasteryTaskOneTests</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>When all tests run successfully, commit and push your code!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You used the debugger to walk through the code (whether you used it to actually find the bug or not--if you see the bug, still practice with the debugger!)</li>
                        <li>You added a new unit test that catches the original bug</li>
                        <li>You fixed the bug</li>
                        <li>Your Mastery Task 1 TCTs are passing locally</li>
                        <li>You have pushed your code</li>
