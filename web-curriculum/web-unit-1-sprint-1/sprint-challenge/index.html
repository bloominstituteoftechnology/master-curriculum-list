        <section class="content-box">
            <h2>Welcome to the Sprint Challenge!</h2>
            <p>Sprint Challenges test your skills on the topics presented during the Sprint. The challenges can be complex but rewarding, as they allow you to apply your newly acquired skills to unique scenarios. Completing all the challenges successfully is one of the milestones to move to the next Sprint.</p>
            
            <h3>Project Instructions</h3>
            <p>Follow these steps to start the challenge and submit your code for grading:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a new folder called "Sprint Challenge" and use the <a href="https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/W_S1_Challenge/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sprint Challenge link</a> to download a zip of the Sprint Challenge code into that folder.</li>
                <li>Unzip the project, open the "Sprint Challenge" folder in VS Code, and follow the README instructions to get started.</li>
                <li>Write code solutions for each problem. Like Module Projects, you can run the built-in tests in your browser to ensure your code is working as intended.</li>
                <li>Once you have completed all the challenges and are ready to submit your code:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Submit your Sprint Challenge in <a href="https://portal.bloomtech.com/instruction/sprint-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the BloomTech Portal.</a></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Use of AI tools:</h3>
            <p>Relying solely on AI tools to solve Sprint Challenges for learners is considered cheating. It's important to note that using AI tools to get help with specific questions, understand a bug, or clarify concepts is acceptable. However, using them as a shortcut to solve problems is not. The value of your BloomTech experience lies in building the foundational skills required to become a successful software engineer, which is only achieved through practice and experience. Therefore, you must prioritize developing your own problem-solving abilities and avoid relying solely on AI tools. Weâ€™ve provided some use cases where using AI tools is appropriate for sustained learning:</p>
            
            <h4>Good use of AI on Sprint Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Using AI prompts to help you get unstuck on an error.</li>
                <li>Clarifying how to use a particular concept.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Poor use of AI on Sprint Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Inputting Sprint Challenge instructions expecting AI tooling to solve the problem.</li>
                <li>Using AI tools to write code for parts of a problem that you don't understand or can't explain how it works.</li>
            </ul>
