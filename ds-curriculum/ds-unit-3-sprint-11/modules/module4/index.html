            <h2>Module Overview</h2>
            <p>You've put together a nice application - time to get it out there! A GitHub repo is great, but a deployed
                application is more effective in your portfolio as everyone in the hiring process (not just technical
                people) can check it out.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> While we use Heroku in this module as our primary deployment platform, it's
                important to know that Heroku has changed its pricing model and is no longer free by default.
                Alternatives like Render, Railway, or Fly.io offer similar functionality with generous free tiers for
                student projects. We'll include resources for these alternatives below.</p>

            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Deploy a basic (single-server) web application to common cloud services</li>

            <h2>Objective 01 - Diving into MongoDB</h2>
            <h3>What is MongoDB?</h3>
            <p>
                MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning
                fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. This provides the
                ability to store, query, and process large amounts of data in myriad ways.
            </p>
            <h3>Setting up a MongoDB Account</h3>
            <p>
                First, you'll need to sign up for a free <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB account</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you'll need a MongoDB project.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create new project and give it a name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As the owner, you'll automatically be added as a user. Click <code>Create Project</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <code>Build a Database</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Choose an <code>M0</code> free tier database. Choose a hosting provider - AWS, Google or Azure. For
                    best
                    performance, select a region close to you. Make sure it says <code>FREE</code> and click
                    <code>Create</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a username and password for your database. Click <code>Create User</code>. Be sure to save
                    this username
                    &amp; password, we will need it later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your current IP address will be automatically added. Add additional IPs as needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <code>Finish and Close</code>, then click <code>Go To Database</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <code>Connect</code>, then click <code>Drivers</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Copy your connection string and save it to a file called <code>.env</code> at the root of the
                    project.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://Admin:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.gyyzea9.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&amp;w=majority</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>You'll need to replace <code>&lt;password&gt;</code> with the password we created in a
                            previous
                            step.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once MongoDB is set up, you can interact with it using PyMongo.</p>

            <h3>What is PyMongo?</h3>
            <p>
                PyMongo is a Python driver for MongoDB. It provides tools to work with MongoDB, allowing you to interact
                with MongoDB databases within your Python programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, you need to install PyMongo with the command:
            </p>
            <pre><code>pip install python-dotenv fastapi pymongo</code></pre>
            <p>
                Then, you can connect to your MongoDB instance and perform various operations:
            </p>
            <h4>PyMongo Basic</h4>
            <pre><code>import os
from pymongo import MongoClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# load the environment variables from the `.env` file
load_dotenv()

# create a MongoClient to interact with your MongoDB instance
db_url = os.getenv("MONGODB_URL")
client = MongoClient(db_url)

# get a reference to your database
db = client['mydatabase']

# get a reference to your collection
collection = db['mycollection']

# insert a document into the collection
collection.insert_one({
  "name": "John Smith", 
  "age": 30, 
  "job": "developer",
  "favorite_language": "Python",
})

# find a document in the collection
document = collection.find_one({"favorite_language": "Python"})

print(document)
</code></pre>

            <h2>Objective 02 - Securely connect a deployed web application to a relational database back-end</h2>
            <h3>Important Note:</h3>
            <p>
                Starting November 28, 2022, all free Heroku programs will no longer be available. You may choose to
                complete this module with the Heroku paid versions, but it is not required to complete this Sprint.
            </p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                As we learned when we discussed full-stack web applications, the back-end handles requests but it is
                generally not the right place to persist data in the longterm. For that, we need a database, and for it
                to work in production we need to connect securely to it. This means using environment variables for
                secrets (passwords), not checking them into git or otherwise exposing them.
            </p>
            <p>
                GitHub is great for your code - but not so great for your API keys. How do you avoid committing secrets
                that grant account access, when <code>git</code> itself is the tool for both backing up, sharing, and
                now deploying your code?
            </p>
            <p>
                For local development, we set up <code>python-dotenv</code> - for the cloud, we'll use <a
                    href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku config vars</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Follow Along</h3>
            <p>
                After you deploy your application for the first time, you need to set all your config vars (Heroku's
                flavor of environment variables). You can retrieve all or one of them from the CLI as follows:
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ heroku config
USERNAME:jane
ENVIRONMENT:production

$ heroku config:get USERNAME
jane
</code></pre>
            <p>
                You can set a username (creating or overriding it) with
                <code>heroku config:set USERNAME=janesmith</code>, and <code>heroku config:unset USERNAME</code> will
                simply remove it entirely.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the command line to set all the config vars you need for your app to work (largely Basilica and
                    Twitter API access).</li>
                <li>Explore the Heroku web site, and find the part of the dashboard corresponding to config vars. Verify
                    that your config vars are there as you set them from the CLI.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note - you don't need to set the <code>DATABASE_URL</code>! Why? Because that gets set automatically
                when it is created (see the last line):
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
Creating heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev on â¬¢ sushi... free
Database has been created and is available
 ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer
 ! data from another database with pg:copy
Created postgresql-concave-52656 as DATABASE_URL
</code></pre>

            <h2>Resource - Git for Build Sprint</h2>
            <h3>Important Note:</h3>
            <p>
                Starting November 28, 2022, all free Heroku programs will no longer be available. You may choose to
                complete this module with the Heroku paid versions, but it is not required to complete this Sprint.
            </p>
            <h3>Git MVP</h3>
            <p>Git MVP includes 4 main requirements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use main as your primary branch</strong><br>
                    You must use main as your primary branch, which is the default when creating a new
                    repository.<br><br>
                    <strong>Why?</strong><br>
                    Branching from the branches other than the main branch can create opportunities for merge conflicts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Feature Branch Naming</strong><br>
                    Feature branches must be named: <code>feature/&lt;descriptive name&gt;</code><br><br>
                    For example, if you're working on a feature that allows users to change the email address in their
                    profile, the branch should be named <code>feature/change-email</code><br><br>
                    More info on branches and how to create a branch can be found here<span>Links to an external
                        site.</span>.<br><br>
                    <strong>Why?</strong><br>
                    Without a good naming convention, it is very easy to lose track of the purpose of a branch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Delete Merged Branches</strong><br>
                    After a branch has been merged to the main branch, it must be immediately deleted.<br><br>
                    <strong>Why?</strong><br>
                    Short-lived branches are a best-practice for minimizing merge conflicts. Leaving many branches
                    active in a repository makes it difficult for team members to navigate the on-going work. Once a
                    branch has been reviewed, approved, and merged into the main branch, it should be immediately
                    deleted.<br>
                    A healthy Git repository has a minimum of active branches.<br>
                    This is easy to comply with using GitHub<span>Links to an external site.</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Build Sprint Git Workflow</strong><br>
                    Following this workflow make it easier to collaborate with your teammates. It will also help prepare
                    you for Labs, since it is very similar to the Git workflow you will use in Labs!<br><br>
                    The idea is that each Trello card should be on its own pull request as a feature!<br><br>
                    The Build Sprint Git Workflow is designed to prepare you for your Labs experience. You can learn
                    more about Git &amp; GitHub in Labs, check out the Engineering Standards<span>Links to an external
                        site.</span>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>You're ready to work on a new Trello card - let's get started!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>WITHOUT FORKING, clone your team's repository.</li>
                <li>After that always make sure you start with a recent copy of the repo.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>git checkout main
git pull origin main
</code></pre>
            <p>
                To get started on your first task let's make a branch. Making sure you are on the main branch, start a
                new branch with a name that matches or correlates to the task you are about to begin.<br>
                The trick here is to think beyond yourself when naming the branch, stay aligned with your Trello board
                so you and others can easily make sense of it.<br>
                <code>git checkout -b [<em>feature/&lt;descriptive name&gt;</em>]</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Sharing Is Good</h3>
            <p>
                Now you have a branch to make all your awesome commits to!
            </p>
            <p>
                Copying the description from the Trello card, which should summarize the actual work in the PR, create a
                Draft Pull Request using the mainbranch as the base after you have made your first commit.<br>
                Github created pull request drafts so that notifications will be turned off by default until you decide
                you are ready for review.
            </p>
            <p>
                This animated gif is of the GitHub page to create pull requests. The dropdown to create a pull request
                is opened, and the option "Create Draft Pull Request" is selected.<span>Links to an external
                    site.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                We have lift off! ð<br>
                Now we're ready to make some awesome software. Committing and pushing our code regularly are habits
                worth having. Before we know it, we'll be ready to take the PR out of draft mode.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tip:</strong> do your best to be a great team member by making commit messages as clear as
                possible. They don't have to be elaborate- keep it to the point.
            </p>
            <h3>One small step ð¨ð¾âð</h3>
            <p>
                When you feel you've completed the task you've been working on, it's time to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Update the description</li>
                <li>Take the PR out of Draft Mode</li>
                <li>Make it "ready for review".</li>
                <li>Ask someone in your team's channel to review your work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The image shows a pull request page on GitHub. The "Ready to review" button is highlighted.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Links to an external site.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The team will then be notified of the PR and they can begin a review before merging it to the main
                branch.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tip:</strong> Follow the team policy regarding the number of reviewers required before merging.
                It's great practice to take the time and make comments in the code, even if just positive notes on good
                work your teammate did.
            </p>
            <h3>Merging to main</h3>
            <p>
                If there are no conflicts to be resolved in the code choose Rebase and merge or Squash and merge from
                the Merge button.
            </p>

                If you find yourself with a merge conflict, there are a number of ways to solve it. The Github tools are
                very handy. You can also do it locally. When going down the local path, there is a good set of
                instructions here<span>Links to an external site.</span>.

                Your code changes are now on the main branch, ready to wow! users with your updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deploy your code (if not otherwise handled by Github Events) and be ready to support and address any
                issues that arise.

                A comic about git. Cueball is showing git on his computer to Ponytail and Hairy. Cueball says, "This is
                git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree model."
                Ponytail responds, "Cool. How do we use it?" Cueball replies, "No idea. Just memorize these shell
                commands and type them to sync up. If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and
                download a fresh copy."<span>Links to an external site.</span>
