                <h3>Deployment Pipeline Overview</h3>
                <p>Deploying software is the process by which code developed on your computer gets shared with the
                    world. The deployment pipeline typically consists of several stages that ensure quality and
                    reliability.</p>

                <h4>Stages of Deployment</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Source Stage</strong>: Local development, testing, code reviews, and pushing to a code
                        repository</li>
                    <li><strong>Build Stage</strong>: Automated build processes, unit tests, and static code analysis
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Test Stage</strong>: Integration testing in isolated environments (often called Beta/QA)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Production Stage</strong>: Deployment to live servers for end-user access</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Each stage serves as a quality gate, ensuring that only properly functioning code moves to the next
                    level. This staged approach minimizes the risk of introducing bugs into production systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Deploying Software at Amazon</h3>
                <p>The act of deploying software is the process by which the software you develop on your computer gets
                    shared with the world! At a high-level view, this involves you writing code on your development
                    machine, then checking that code into the source code repository. From there the deployment system
                    builds your change and runs unit and integration tests verifying your change before finally
                    delivering your code bug free (hopefully) to end users. We'll be walking through each stage of this
                    process in this reading.</p>

                <h4>Challenges at Amazon</h4>
                <p>Before we dig into the nuts and bolts of the deployment process, let's take a look at why we've put
                    so much effort into standardizing our process. Any company deploying code to their customers faces
                    challenges, and those only multiply when you have many teams developing many products across many
                    code bases deploying to many servers around the world! That is a tremendous number of moving parts,
                    so Amazon has dedicated time and money to tools that ensure we can manage all those moving parts and
                    deploy our changes with consistency and quality.</p>

                <h4>Deployment pipeline overview</h4>

                <img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/72110d81-99c8-42aa-9cc6-4297a900f0e9_image1.png"

                <p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> An overview of the development pipeline showing the flow from the Source
                    stage - where we develop the code, complete local testing, get a code review, and finally push to
                    the remote code repository - to the Build stage - where an automated build runs our unit tests and
                    static code analysis to verify our code change - to the Beta stage - where new changes are tested in
                    an experimental stage - to the Gamma stage - where new changes are run against production data
                    without facing actual customers - and finally to the Production stage - where our code goes live and
                    actual customers see the change.</p>

                <p>The Amazon deployment pipeline is broken into four major stages, culminating in the final deployment
                    to the live users in production. Amazon's <a href="https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Pipelines"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pipelines</a> system automates the deployment of our
                    code changes through the different stages. Each stage is distinct from the rest, either interacting
                    with another service or running on its own set of hosts separate to the other stages.</p>

                <p>The Source stage covers local development, local testing, code reviews and finally pushing code to
                    the remote code repository. The git system we use allows developers to work together on the same
                    projects without stepping on each other's toes. As such, it is one of the most important tools that
                    Amazon developers use every day.</p>

                <p>Once we push to the remote repository at the end of the Source stage, Pipelines moves our change into
                    the Build stage, where all of the packages in our version set (the dependencies of our package, our
                    package, and packages that depend on our package) are built together, unit tests are run, and code
                    coverage tests are run.</p>

                <p>If our build succeeds and our test and verifications pass, the pipeline will promote the package to
                    the Beta stage. Here, tests are run against the deployed service to ensure all the changes work
                    together, along with other services our service may interact with. These tests are called
                    integration tests.</p>

                <p>If our integration tests all pass in Beta, our changes move to the Gamma stage. In the Gamma stage,
                    our code will be tested again with production data. Integration tests are run on the Gamma stage as
                    well. And while we strive for fully-automated testing, the Gamma stage is where any required manual
                    testing usually occurs. Depending on the size of the team, that manual testing might be completed by
                    the software developers on the team, or there might be dedicated Quality Assurance Engineers (QAEs)
                    whose job it is to develop and execute testing plans to validate that changes are working correctly.
                </p>

                <p>Once our changes have been approved in Gamma, they are promoted to Production, where they are
                    available to customers! We don't run more tests on Production, but we do have monitors set up
                    tracking the status of our system. If we see anything shortly after deployment indicating a problem
                    with our service (for example, a lot of NullPointerExceptions suddenly appear in our service logs),
                    Pipelines can rollback our deployment, re-deploying the previous, working version of our service.
                    This protects both us and our customers from a service outage while we investigate the issue.</p>

                <h4>Big Projects -- Big Impact -- Big Challenges</h4>
                <p>You may have seen testing mentioned over and over in the previous section. This underlines how
                    important testing is to the deployment process. Quality and velocity are the primary goals of our
                    deployment process. When we say quality, we mean bug-free code that delivers value to our customers.
                    By velocity, we mean how fast we go from an idea, to implementation, to release of a new feature,
                    improvement, or bug fix. Consistent testing across all stages is key to delivering quality software
                    to our customers while working quickly. Thorough testing throughout our deployment process helps us
                    catch bugs early, where they are easier and quicker to fix. This lets us regularly deliver new
                    products and features to our customers without glaring bugs.</p>

                <p>In addition to quality and velocity, our deployment process enables coordination within groups and
                    across organizations as software is developed by many teams and many individuals. Pipelines apply a
                    consistent quality bar and ensure that changes from various people or teams work together before
                    those changes reach customers.</p>

                <h4>Continuous Deployment</h4>
                <p>The concept of Continuous Deployment isn't only a nice way to describe how we are continuously
                    deploying new features and new fixes, but it's also a recognized Software Development process.
                    Continuous Deployment is a strategy for developing and releasing software that automates the testing
                    and deployment process in order to reduce the amount of repetitive work done by humans. Automating
                    the tasks that nobody likes to do manually reduces the potential for human error.</p>

                <p>Continuous deployment supports our underlying principles as well. It helps to ensure quality through
                    rigorous automated testing that takes place at every stage for every piece of code written.
                    Coordination is improved by giving every code package its own deployment pipeline to ensure that
                    code for that package is tested and deployed to the servers or devices that are configured correctly
                    for each stage. With new code being constantly tested and deployed bottlenecks in the system are
                    reduced and velocity is improved. Notifications of code failure are sent out quickly, and fixes will
                    automatically start a new deployment.</p>

                <p>It's important to note that it is still possible (and likely) that a bug in someone's code could
                    block your code's deployment or vice versa. This situation does impact velocity, but it also ensures
                    quality. There is always a tradeoff. As a developer, it's important to realize that there may be
                    times when the process can feel slow, but Amazon has tried to find the best balance between timely
                    deployment and code quality.</p>

                <h4>The Stages of Continuous Deployment</h4>
                <p>At this point, we would like to walk through all the steps involved in each stage of the continuous
                    deployment process. We will specifically be looking at the Actions that are taken in each stage, the
                    Approvals required to move past the stage, and any Blockers that could come up in that stage.</p>

                <h5>Source Stage</h5>
                <p>The source stage is the first stage and the stage where you, as a developer, have the most
                    responsibilities.</p>

                <p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
                <p>In this stage, a task has been given to a developer, and code will be written. The developer will
                    test their changes in a local environment. Unit tests and integration tests are written and verified
                    here as part of the development process to verify their code works as expected. Once all development
                    is complete, the developer will commit their code locally and publish a code review.</p>

                <p>The code review is when other developers review the code, providing guidance or suggestions and
                    potentially catching bugs. This is a time for teammates to ensure code is being developed following
                    the team's best practices and coding style. Those who did not write the code become familiar with
                    the new code they will also be responsible for.</p>

                <p><strong>Approvals</strong></p>
                <p>The approval needed in the Source stage is an approved Code Review.</p>

                <p><strong>Blockers</strong></p>
                <p>The code review is designed to ensure that code functionality, quality, and style adhere to the
                    project specifications and team's standards. If the developer's peers feel there are inconsistencies
                    or improvements, the team can work together during the review to make adjustments and revisions. At
                    this point, the code has NOT yet entered the deployment pipeline, but this is an important part of
                    the development process.</p>

                <p><strong>Final Action</strong></p>
                <p>Once the Code Review is approved, the developer pushes the code to the remote repository.</p>

                <h5>Build Stage</h5>
                <p>The Build stage marks the beginning of the Continuous Deployment pipeline.</p>

                <p><strong>Automated Actions</strong></p>
                <p>A pipeline triggers a new build whenever changes are pushed to a package that the pipeline is
                    configured to auto-build. The build system pulls down all the code, builds it (which includes
                    running any unit tests), and prepares to pass the built code to the next pipeline stage. After the
                    build completes, Static Code Analysis is run against the changes to approve them.</p>

                <p><strong>Approval</strong></p>
                <p>The Code Analysis that is done after the code is built marks the next approval point. Static code
                    analysis can include the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Verification that Code Reviews were done and approved.</li>
                    <li>Verifying code coverage on newly added code and/or the package(s) that was changed meets a
                        configured level.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Blockers</strong></p>
                <p>If the build fails (either because it could not compile of unit tests failed) or any of the Static
                    Code Analysis verifications fail, then the deployment to the next stage is stopped. Notifications
                    will be automatically generated to alert the pipeline owner of the failure. Depending on how the
                    pipeline is configured, a new ticket may be generated to track the issue.</p>

                <p><strong>Final Action</strong></p>
                <p>If the code builds successfully and all Static Code Analysis passes, then the build output is
                    promoted to the next stage of the pipeline.</p>

                <h5>Test & Deploy</h5>
                <p>After the build stage is approved, the built code will go through a series of stages that can be
                    simplified down to "Test & Deploy". As it moves along, tests are run against environments more and
                    more similar to Production.</p>

                <h5>Beta Stage</h5>
                <p>The term "beta testing" has been used for decades in software development to refer to the process of
                    testing something before it's done. New features and new products come together in their first
                    shared environment to begin testing how all the pieces of the project fit together. The
                    "environment" here is a server (or AWS account) that is configured to run the code in a dedicated
                    space for testing, referred to as the beta stage. Beta is the first place where a code change in one
                    service can interact with another service. We often wire our beta stage to the beta stages of any
                    other services our service uses. We describe the beta stage as "shared" because the code being
                    tested here will have been written by many developers and potentially multiple development teams.
                    Beta is an environment where the data is often in flux as new features are quickly deployed.</p>

                <p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
                <p>Code is deployed to the Beta stage after the build succeeds and is approved. Testing here is usually
                    automated, but developers might manually test features on Beta if they need to test inter-service
                    interactions that their local version of the service cannot replicate.</p>

                <p><strong>Approval</strong></p>
                <p>Approval on beta is based on the integration tests that are run against the build here. These are
                    automated tests that go beyond the code coverage and unit testing of the build stage in order to
                    ensure our system as a whole is functioning as expected. The developer will have written integration
                    tests for their code and submitted them along with the rest of the code change in the Source stage.
                    The testing here is closer to production and will be tested against real services, no longer
                    utilizing mocks. Instead of setting up mocks, integration tests will usually have preliminary steps
                    that set up starter data in the service for the tests to use. As new code is developed and deployed
                    to beta, the integration tests continue to be run to catch any bugs the new code might introduce in
                    existing functionality.</p>

                <p><strong>Blockers</strong></p>
                <p>If any of the automated integration tests fail, the deployment process is stopped and the system will
                    send out automated notifications describing what failed. Depending on how the pipeline is
                    configured, a new ticket may be generated and assigned to the pipeline owner, at which point the
                    team's oncall can determine who was responsible for the breaking change and inform them that they
                    need to investigate and fix the bug.</p>

                <p><strong>Final Action</strong></p>
                <p>Once all integration tests pass, the code change is promoted to the Gamma stage of the deployment
                    pipeline.</p>

                <h5>Gamma Stage</h5>
                <p>For Amazon the Gamma stage (or pre-prod, short for pre-production) represents the last testing
                    environment before Production. Gamma should mimic the production environment as closely as possible
                    in order to provide the most realistic tests for the code. Data here is often a snapshot of real
                    production data. If a team has Quality Assurance Engineers involved in testing their code, they are
                    usually testing code once it has reached the Gamma stage.</p>

                <p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
                <p>More automated testing, as well as manual validation, can take place in the Gamma stage.</p>

                <p><strong>Approval</strong></p>
                <p>Final acceptance testing is done here. Our goal is to have all final acceptance testing automated.
                    This includes running our integration tests, and can include other automated steps, like load
                    testing our service, which simulates high traffic (like we see on Prime Day or around holidays)
                    hitting our service to see if it can handle all the requests. Our approvals here may also include
                    manual tests if we are unable to automate the actions necessary to test some aspects of our service.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Blockers</strong></p>
                <p>As with other stages, any tests that fail will trigger the deployment process to be halted. Often the
                    issues found here are more complicated or far-reaching, but like everything else, they will trigger
                    notifications so that they can be addressed by a team of QAEs and SDEs and move through this entire
                    process again when they are fixed to ensure the best experience for our customers.</p>

                <p>The tests performed in Gamma are generally more thorough and look at more than pure technical
                    functionality compared to previous stages. It is also painful to be blocked this late in the
                    process, but it happens. If the deployment pipeline has done its job, then the number of issues that
                    come up in the Gamma stage should be low.</p>

                <p><strong>Final Action</strong></p>
                <p>Once the Gamma build is approved, the code is promoted to Production in the pipeline.</p>

                <h5>Production</h5>
                <p>This is it. The big time. Production is what this whole process is about. Production is live to our
                    customers and all the code there has gone through this entire process in order to ensure it is of
                    the highest quality with the fewest bugs.</p>

                <p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
                <p>Once all the tests on Gamma have been successfully completed, the code can be pushed out to
                    production. For the most part, deployments from Gamma to Production are automated, but on some
                    teams, they remain manual. At Amazon, we often deploy our code to regions all over the world over
                    the period of a week. In this case, "Production" might actually be a dozen stages as we deploy in
                    waves spanning some of our smallest regions (like Frankfurt, Germany), to our largest (Virginia,
                    USA).</p>

                <p><strong>Approval</strong></p>
                <p>While we do not generally run more tests against our production service, we do track that our
                    deployment succeeds. We can set up monitors that track statistics about our service (such as traffic
                    logs, service logs, or resource access logs) and alarm if it looks like something has gone wrong.
                    This could include lots of exceptions suddenly appearing in our logs, or our traffic suddenly
                    dropping a significant amount, or our DynamoDB tables reporting many more read requests than there
                    were before the deployment. If one of these alarms goes off within a set time after our deployment,
                    our pipeline can rollback that deployment, re-deploying the previous version of our service blocking
                    deployments.</p>

                <p>A production rollback will certainly generate a new ticket to the team, and the oncall will be
                    responsible for figuring out what has gone wrong and coordinating a fix.</p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>As you can see, there are a lot of moving parts that all work together to deploy software at Amazon.
                    We hope you're also beginning to see why there's so much going on. In order to provide our customers
                    with the highest quality software products we need to ensure that we follow a well-defined process
                    that validates our deliverables at every step of the process. In the next reading we're going to
                    look at a larger example of how all these pieces work together as we follow some code through the
                    pipeline from creation to production.</p>

                <h3>Deployment Environments</h3>
                <p>Modern deployment practices utilize multiple environments to safely test and validate changes before
                    they reach customers.</p>

                <h4>Common Deployment Environments</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Development</strong>: Where initial coding and testing occur</li>
                    <li><strong>Beta/QA</strong>: Where integration testing across services happens</li>
                    <li><strong>Staging/Gamma</strong>: A pre-production environment that closely mimics production
                        configuration</li>
                    <li><strong>Production</strong>: The live environment that serves end users</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Beta stage is where tests run to ensure all components work together correctly. The Gamma stage
                    uses production-like data and configuration for final validation before deployment.</p>

                <h4>Benefits of Multiple Environments</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Safely test and verify changes without affecting users</li>
                    <li>Separate test data from production data</li>
                    <li>Identify integration issues early</li>
                    <li>Validate performance in realistic conditions</li>
                    <li>Enable gradual rollout strategies</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Testing in the Deployment Pipeline</h3>
                <p>Different types of tests should be executed at appropriate stages of the deployment pipeline to catch
                    issues early and prevent costly bugs in production.</p>

                <h4>Types of Tests</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unit Tests</strong>: Test individual components in isolation (Source/Build stage)</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration Tests</strong>: Test interactions between components (Beta/QA stage)</li>
                    <li><strong>System Tests</strong>: Test the application as a whole (Beta/QA stage)</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Tests</strong>: Test application speed and reliability (Staging/Gamma stage)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Acceptance Tests</strong>: Validate that requirements are met (Staging/Gamma stage)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Testing Best Practices</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Run tests as early as possible in the pipeline</li>
                    <li>Automate tests whenever possible</li>
                    <li>Use isolated test environments with appropriate test data</li>
                    <li>Ensure test coverage across critical functionality</li>
                    <li>Incorporate security testing in the pipeline</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Right now we have 5 different Lambda functions that are responsible for the REST API methods we'd
                    like our users to have access to. That's great but not very useable.</p>

                <p>What we'd like now is to build a Gateway on AWS that maps HTTP requests to lambda functions. Refer to
                    the Design Document for specific end points.</p>

                <p>We will build this together during our final guided project.</p>
