                    <p>Gradle is an open-source build automation tool that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and
                        Apache Maven but introduces a more flexible Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) for
                        declaring project configurations. It uses a directed acyclic graph to determine the order of
                        task execution.</p>

                <h2>Introduction to Gradle</h2>
                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>When creating Java applications, there can be a lot of additional complexity and overhead beyond
                        simply writing Java code. Although we'd like to focus our effort on the codebase of our project,
                        we still need to consider things such as building our project, installing and managing
                        libraries, testing, and sharing our project with coworkers. While we could meticulously handle
                        these tasks, using an application manager to perform them can be much easier. The application
                        manager we use in this course is Gradle. In this lesson, we will discuss how Gradle can help you
                        save time and effort with your projects, and you will learn to create a project using Gradle.
                    </p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Prerequisite Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>At this point, you should have some knowledge of writing simple scripts in Java and be
                        comfortable using your command line (or terminal) to navigate file directories and install
                        packages.</p>
                    <p>You may have used Gradle before in a previous project; however, no prior knowledge of Gradle or
                        how it works will be necessary.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>What can Gradle do for you?</h3>
                    <p>Let's first discuss why we would use Gradle in the first place.</p>
                    <p>Primarily, Gradle streamlines the process of building your project. Gradle can perform various
                        build functions, such as build, test, and run. Additionally, Gradle manages your dependencies
                        for you. A dependency is any code from an outside resource. These resources are often called
                        libraries. It's important to distinguish between a library and a dependency since the two are
                        related and often used interchangably. A library is a group of code that performs a set of
                        actions while a dependency is a library that your code needs to run. Nearly every project you
                        encounter will rely on dependencies your code will need to download and install. These tasks can
                        be tedious and tiresome if done manually, but Gradle can gracefully build, test, run, and import
                        dependencies into your project.</p>
                    <p>Gradle uses a single file to hold nearly all of its project configurations: the build script.
                        This file ensures the project is set up the same way every time - with all the correct
                        dependencies and build specifications. The build script is handy when multiple developers work
                        on the same project because everyone is building the project with the same configuration.
                        Without Gradle and the build script, each team member would probably configure their projects
                        differently, causing each project to behave differently.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Building a Project Without Gradle</h3>
                    <p>Before we use Gradle, let's take a quick look at what it takes to run a Java project without
                        Gradle.</p>
                    <p>For this coding example, create a folder on your computer named hello-world using the command
                        line. Mimic the following folder structure by adding a srs/main/java directory structure. Open
                        hello-world/src/main/java in any text editor (such as Atom or VSCode) and create a new file
                        named Greeter.java.</p>
                    <p>Your file structure should look like this:</p>
                    <pre><code>hello-world
└── src
    └── main
        └── java
            └── Greeter.java</code></pre>

                    <p>Copy the following code so that our Greeter.java file defines a Greeter class:</p>
                    <pre><code>public class Greeter {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    greetUser("BloomtechStudent");
  }

  public static void greetUser(String username) {
    System.out.println("Hello " + username + "! Welcome to the server!");
  }
}</code></pre>

                    <p>We can't run this java file just yet. We first need to convert it into a .class binary file. Then
                        we can use the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from our command line to run the program.</p>
                    <p>In your command line, navigate to hello-world/src/main/java where our Greeter.java file lives.
                        Enter the following command to compile this file into a Greeter.class binary file.</p>
                    <pre><code>javac Greeter.java</code></pre>
                    <p>javac stands for "Java Compile" and it takes java files and turns them into class files that the
                        computer can run. With our newly created class file, we can run our Java code with the following
                        command:</p>
                    <pre><code>java Greeter</code></pre>
                    <p>You should see that it outputs: Hello BloomtechStudent! Welcome to the server!</p>
                    <p>You did it! Since this project doesn't use Gradle, we would need to repeat this process for each
                        new Java file, and any time we changed our program. If we were using any dependencies, we'd have
                        to manually download and do extra work to make sure those compiled as well. If you image this
                        process in a project with 100's of Java files, you can start to see this doesn't scale well. It
                        can become a dizzying task trying to build a large project.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully, you can start to appreciate how much nicer it'd be if we had a single configurable
                        command to do all of this for us. This is what an application manager such as Gradle can
                        provide.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Creating a Gradle Project</h3>
                    <p>In this section, we will create a similar application to the one above, this time using Gradle to
                        manage the building of our project. Additionally, we will add a dependency and see how Gradle
                        manages our dependencies.</p>
                    <p>We will be using Gradle version 7.0.2 in this course. You can follow the tutorial on this page<a
                            href="https://gradle.org/install/">Links to an external site</a> for instructions specific
                        to your operating system. Replace the listed version number with 7.0.2 to be consistent with our
                        projects.</p>

                    <h3>Initializing a Java Project Using Gradle</h3>
                    <p>From your command line and with Gradle installed<a href="https://gradle.org/install/">Links to an
                            external site</a>, create a new project folder named intro-to-gradle. Go into this folder
                        and run the following command:</p>
                    <pre><code>gradle init</code></pre>
                    <p>You'll be prompted first for the type of project, select 1 for basic.</p>
                    <pre><code>Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 1</code></pre>
                    <p>Next, you will be asked which build script language you will use. In this course, we will uae
                        Groovy for all of our build scripts. With Groovy, we'll only be using simple commands so there's
                        no need to learn it in-depth as we've done for Java.</p>
                    <pre><code>Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1</code></pre>
                    <p>Finally, you will be prompted for a project name, with the directory's name as the default
                        option. You can pass in any empty character (just press enter/return) to use the default name.
                    </p>
                    <p>After finishing the prompts, your complete command history should look something like this:</p>
                    <pre><code>gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 1

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Project name (default: intro-to-gradle):

                    <p>You should now see that your directory contains several new files and folders:</p>

gradle		
gradlew		
gradlew.bat
settings.gradle</code></pre>
                    <p>The build.gradle file is where we can configure how Gradle builds and runs your project. Open
                        build.gradle in a text editor and add the Java and application plugins by writing the following
                        command:</p>
                    <pre><code>plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
}</code></pre>
                    <p>These lines tell Gradle that this is a Java application.</p>

                    <h3>Adding Our Java Source Code</h3>
                    <p>Now we can write some Java code! Gradle will look for Java code under the directory src/main/java
                        by default. Create the same src/main/java file structure we did before. Within the java folder,
                        add the Greeter.java file we used in the previous example. The project's file structure should
                        look like this:</p>
                    <pre><code>├── build
├── build.gradle

        └── java
            └── Greeter.java</code></pre>
                    <p>You can now run the project using gradle run, but you will see an error with the message: No main
                        class specified and classpath is not an executable jar. This means we need to specify in our
                        build script the class which contains the entry point for our application. Of course, we only
                        have one class, and we can specify this in build.gradle by adding the following script:</p>
                    <pre><code>application {
   mainClass = 'Greeter'
}</code></pre>
                    <p>Run the project again by entering gradle run into the terminal. You should see now that it
                        outputs the message to the console.</p>
                    <pre><code>Hello BloomtechStudent! Welcome to the server!</code></pre>
                    <p>Anytime you change code, all you will need to run is gradle run.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Adding a Dependency</h3>
                    <p>Currently, we have a Greeter application that uses a greetUser method to welcome a user to the
                        (pretend) server. Let's say we want to validate that usernames contain only alphanumeric
                        characters. There's a library for that! It's called the Apache Commons lang3 library. Manually
                        bringing in a dependency can require a lot of steps, but Gradle makes it easy. We only need to
                        tell Gradle where to find it.</p>
                    <p>We'll first need to specify where the library is hosted. Many hosting networks exist that house
                        many popular libraries and we need to specify which hosts Gradle should look at to search for
                        libraries. The host that we'll use is mavenCentral.</p>
                    <p>In our build script we first add mavenCentral to our list of repositories like so:</p>
                    <pre><code>repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}</code></pre>
                    <p>With the repository listed, we can now add our Apache Commons dependency. A quick Google search
                        for "StringUtils gradle dependency" will usually lead you to the line you need to add. Doing
                        this we can find the library on Maven Repository's site<a
                            href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-lang3/3.0">Links to an
                            external site</a> and we can copy the provided Groovy instruction.</p>
                    <pre><code>dependencies {
    implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.0'
}</code></pre>
                    <p>With the dependency in place, enter gradle build and after a successful build, the Apache Commons
                        lang3 library is now available in your project. Notice that we did not run the gradle run
                        command. That's because running gradle build will get those dependencies for us without running
                        the project, saving us some time.</p>

                        alphanumeric values. Let's use our new dependency's StringUtils class to validate our usernames:
                    </p>

                    <p>Java will likely import StringUtils, but in case it doesn't, add this line to the top of your

                    <p>In the main method of the Greeter class, add another greetUser call with the invalid user

                    <p>You should see we get an Exception for "Bloom_Admin@email.com" and that it greets
                        "BloomtechStudent".</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>We've now seen how an application manager like Gradle can simplify the process of building our
                        Java projects. You won't be spending much time configuring Gradle in your job. However,
                        understanding some of Gradle's basic configurations can be helpful when you need to add
                        dependencies and share build settings. Gradle can do so much more, but for now, you have enough
                        knowledge to move on.</p>
