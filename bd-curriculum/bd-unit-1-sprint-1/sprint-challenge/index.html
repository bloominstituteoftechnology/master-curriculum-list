            <h2>Using Git with Sprint Project</h2>
            <p><strong>Clone Project</strong></p>
            <p>Open the project with Github classroom, copy the url, and use git clone to bring it down to your machine.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Create Branches</strong></p>
            <p>Each Sprint should be worked on with a separate branch. It is recommended you branch off of main into a new branch, sprint-1, and complete all of the mastery tasks in order for sprint-1. When finished you may choose to merge sprint-1 onto main or not. Create a new branch off of either sprint-1 or main(only if you merged onto main) called sprint-2 for work on the second set of mastery tasks. Repeat for sprint-3.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Pushing Branches</strong></p>
            <p>Each Sprint should have its own branches. As you push changes, make sure they are being pushed to the correct branches on GitHub.</p>

            <h3>Sprint Project Workflow</h3>
            <p>Here's a step-by-step guide to working on your sprint project:</p>
            
            <h4>Initial Setup</h4>
            <pre><code># Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bd-java-fundamentals-project.git
cd bd-java-fundamentals-project

# Create a branch for sprint-1
git branch sprint-1
git checkout sprint-1</code></pre>
            
            <h4>Working on Tasks</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete each mastery task in the order they're presented</li>
                <li>Regularly commit your changes with descriptive messages:
                <pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "Complete Task 1: Add variable declarations"</code></pre></li>
                <li>Push your changes to your branch:
                <pre><code>git push --set-upstream origin sprint-1</code></pre></li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Working on Multiple Sprints</h4>
            <p>When you're ready to move to the next sprint:</p>
            <pre><code># Option 1: Create sprint-2 from sprint-1
git checkout sprint-1
git branch sprint-2
git checkout sprint-2

# Option 2: Create sprint-2 from main
git checkout main
git branch sprint-2
git checkout sprint-2</code></pre>
            
            <h4>Submission Tips</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure your last commit is pushed before the deadline</li>
                <li>Verify your changes are visible on GitHub</li>
                <li>Remember that each branch is scored independently, so ensure you're working on the correct branch for each sprint</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Mastery Task 2 - Class Properties</h3>
                <h4>Mastery Task Guidelines</h4>
                <p>Mastery Tasks are opportunities to test your knowledge and understanding through code. When a mastery task is shown in a module, it means that we've covered all the concepts that you need to complete that task. You will want to make sure you finish them in a timely fashion to stay on track and complete the sprint.</p>
                
                <p>Each mastery task must pass 100% of the automated tests and code styling checks. Your code must be your own. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out for support.</p>
                
                <h4>AppSettings Update</h4>
                <p>Go to com.adventure.settings.AppSettings and update the story to MT2_CaveEscape.</p>
                
                <h4>Properties</h4>
                <p>A property is a Class instance variable, usually marked private, that is associated with getter/setter methods in the class. For example, a Person has the property age, which can store the value 30. One can reference that value using the getter method for the property. If you need to change the age because it's the person's birthday, you can simply assign a new value (31) to the property using it's setter method.</p>
                
                <h4>Working Classes</h4>
                <p>We will be working with the following class:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Player</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Player</h4>
                <p>Player is a class that has been built out considerably, but there are some new properties that we want to add as well as some methods to access the properties.</p>
                
                <h4>Name</h4>
                <p>The property we're adding today is name. This property will hold a String and we don't want outside classes to have direct access to it, so make the scope private.</p>
                
                <p>With that property in place, we can now write the getter and setter methods for name. They are called getName and setName. The methods are already defined, but they don't do anything (at the moment). Read the comments above each method to see what the requirements are and write the code to complete the requirements.</p>
                
                <h4>Arithmetic in Code</h4>
                <p>The last thing you'll need to do is calculate if the player can open a door (the doors are heavy). Find the method canOpenDoor and read the comments to find out how to validate if the player can open doors.</p>
                
                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>To run the tests for this assignment, run the following:</p>
                <pre><code>./gradlew test --tests com.adventure.MT2</code></pre>
                <p>or by right-clicking the MT2 file and selecting "Run 'MT2'"</p>
                
                <p>You can check your code styling by running the linter with the following command:</p>
                <pre><code>./gradlew checkstyleMain</code></pre>
                
                <p>You can run the game by going to the Main class and clicking on the run icon to the left of the main() method.</p>

                <h3>Mastery Task 3 - String Manipulation</h3>
                <h4>Mastery Task Guidelines</h4>
                <p>Mastery Tasks are opportunities to test your knowledge and understanding through code. When a mastery task is shown in a module, it means that we've covered all the concepts that you need to complete that task. You will want to make sure you finish them in a timely fashion to stay on track and complete the sprint.</p>
                
                <p>Each mastery task must pass 100% of the automated tests and code styling checks. Your code must be your own. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out for support.</p>
                
                <h4>AppSettings Update</h4>
                <p>Go to com.adventure.settings.AppSettings and update the story to MT3_TestDirections.</p>
                
                <h4>String Interpolation and Manipulation</h4>
                <p>Strings can be taken apart and put together in order to handle user inputs, provide outputs, format values properly, and so much more. In this assignment, we'll be taking user inputs and breaking them into manageable pieces as well as providing formatted outputs.</p>
                
                <h4>Working Classes</h4>
                <p>We will be working with the following classes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GameInputProcessor (adventure.GameInputProcessor)</li>
                    <li>Player (adventure.player.Player)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>GameInputProcessor</h4>
                <p>The GameInputProcessor class prompts the user for input and then structures it in such a way that the game can understand what it needs to do next.</p>
                
                <p>You'll first want to gather user inputs in the prompt() method. Here you'll want to use the Scanner class to gather and return user inputs. Once you have Scanner taking in inputs, you can test it by running the game (run it from the Main class). If the app crashes after entering your name, it's not working right.</p>
                
                <p>Next, you'll need to implement the buildSimpleCommand() method which will return a Command object that the game can use. buildSimpleCommand() will split the user input into two parts: the verb and the object.</p>
                
                <p>After you break up the user input, you can construct the Command object by passing it the verb (the first word) and the object (the remaining string, which in the case of this method, will always be blank).</p>
                
                <p>For the buildCommandWithObject() method, you will want to get the verb the same way as before, but also supply the rest of the string as the object.</p>
                
                <h4>Player</h4>
                <p>With the commands now returning their proper object, we're going to implement one of the commands: move.</p>
                
                <p>In the Player class, you'll find the move() method. Here you'll want to take the direction that is given and if it's "east", you'll want to increment the currentLocationIndex. If the direction is "west", you'll want to decrement the 'currentLocationIndex'.</p>
                
                <p>Since you can't always move east or west in the game, an extra parameter is provided that lets you know if the value is invalid (isValid). If the value is invalid, you'll need to send the user the following message: "{DIRECTION} is not a valid direction".</p>
                
                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>To run the tests for this assignment, run the following:</p>
                <pre><code>./gradlew test --tests com.adventure.MT3</code></pre>
                <p>or by right-clicking the MT3 file and selecting "Run 'MT3'"</p>
                
                <p>You can check your code styling by running the linter with the following command:</p>
                <pre><code>./gradlew checkstyleMain</code></pre>
                
                <p>You can run the game by going to the Main class and clicking on the run icon to the left of the main() method.</p>
