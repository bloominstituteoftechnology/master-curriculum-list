              <h2>Intro to React</h2>

              <p>In this Core Competency, you will delve into the heart and soul of React programming, exploring its fundamental building blocks that empower developers to create powerful and interactive user interfaces.</p>

              <p>React (React.js or ReactJS as it is sometimes referred to) is considered to be the new architecture for JavaScript Web Development. A favorite amongst developers worldwide, React is not only a JavaScript library, but a new approach to web design and implementation. It was originally developed - as Facebook still maintains it.</p>

              <p>It all started as a desire to build new features over vanilla JS to make it easier for Facebook to create and maintain its complex interface. But eventually, React became a very popular open-source tool, given its modular nature. React can also be considered a framework, as it offers other modules for more advanced applications. You will explore some of them!</p>

              <p>Third-party frameworks (collections of practices, modules, and libraries) are also built to work with React. For instance, Next.JS is a popular framework that contains tools for optimizations, data fetching, and server components. But let's not get overwhelmed!</p>

              <p>First, you will learn the fundamental concepts of React and how to bootstrap a React app in your local environment. At its core, React revolves around the concept of components. Components are encapsulated units of functionality that allow developers to break down complex user interfaces into smaller, reusable parts. With React, we harness the power of these building blocks to construct dynamic and responsive UIs with ease.</p>

              <h3>Understanding the React Library</h3>

              <p>React has quickly become one of the most commonly used libraries for building applications today.</p>

              <p>Because you've now seen some code that allows you to build custom components with so-called vanilla JavaScript (JS), you've understood how to use JS to manipulate DOM elements. React will take that knowledge you have learned and abstract away many of the traditional DOM syntax, methods, and properties (e.g., document.getElementByClassname). As you'll see later, your entire application will live within one targeted DOM element. React will handle the rest for you.</p>

              <p>User interfaces today are rich and must deal with ever-changing data. As users interact with DOM elements and many animations and events are fired, the DOM is undoubtedly doing a lot of work. Imagine an app like Twitter or Facebook with users clicking everywhere and constantly changing data (including instant status updates). For these types of large-scale applications, React is very helpful, but you can also use React to bootstrap a simple application quickly!</p>

              <p>To keep up with today's demands of the web, we need a way to build applications that can take care of much of the work for us. As developers, we should concentrate on the actual business logic of the application instead of worrying about every single element of the page. Think of React as a higher-level programming language, if you will.</p>

              <p>Let's face it, working with the DOM API is hard. The React team recognizes this, so they built a simple engine called the virtual DOM that interacts with the actual DOM for us. We tell the virtual DOM what to render to the actual DOM, and it will do so. Beyond that, it will "react" when our app's state (current condition) changes and will update the DOM accordingly. All on its own!</p>

              <p>In a process called "reconciliation," React will detect that the app's state has changed. Then it will update the virtual DOM, noting which nodes have changed due to the state changes. Finally, once it knows which nodes have changed, it will update only those specific nodes on the actual DOM. React takes a lot of pressure off our browsers (and significantly reduces the code size), and it's why React is as powerful as it is.</p>

              <p>Today, web applications are enormous, complex pieces of software that millions and millions of users interact with simultaneously. React provides a smooth experience for our users, as well as for those developing applications.</p>
