                <h3>Introduction to Mocking</h3>
                <p>Mocking is essential for writing effective unit tests. It allows you to test classes in isolation by
                    creating dummy implementations of their dependencies. This ensures your tests are deterministic,
                    fast, and focused on the specific code you're testing.</p>
                <p>Mock objects let you define the output of method calls from dependencies, giving you precise control
                    over test conditions without relying on external systems or real implementation details.</p>

                <h3>When to Use Mocking</h3>
                <p>Mocking provides several key benefits in unit testing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deterministic tests:</strong> Tests produce predictable results regardless of external
                        factors</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing edge cases:</strong> Easily test rare conditions that are difficult to reproduce
                        naturally</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Tests run faster without waiting for real dependencies like databases or
                        networks</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost efficiency:</strong> Avoid expenses associated with real services or resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Test only your specific code unit without interference from
                        dependencies</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>In a previous lesson, we introduced unit testing to assess the methods in our classes. Sometimes the
                    classes we want to test are tightly intertwined with the functionality of other classes. This can
                    make our unit testing complicated. We might not be able to test all the precise test conditions we
                    desire. In this lesson, we're going to introduce mocking. Mock objects are dummy implementations of
                    our dependencies that allow us to define the output of their method calls.</p>
                <p>In the first reading, we'll introduce mocking concepts and why we want to use them. We'll then set up
                    an example that we'll be using throughout this lesson to show mocking in code. By the end of this
                    reading, we'll have our mock and test objects set up.<br>In the second reading, we'll continue using
                    our mocking example to show how to write deterministic tests. We'll explore how to determine what to
                    mock and how to turn that logic into code. We'll also discuss additional methods that give greater
                    flexibility over our deterministic tests and outputs.</p>

                <h3>What are mocks?</h3>
                <p>Mock objects are dummy objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way.
                    They're used to test the behavior of some other object. For example, when testing the safety
                    functions of a car, we insert a crash test dummy to simulate the behavior of a real person in a
                    crash. This gives us a good idea of how the safety features will protect a real person without
                    having to endanger anyone.</p>
                <p>Similarly, we can mock objects in Java. Mock objects allow us to mock, or imitate, the functionality
                    of an object's method when writing tests. For example, say we have an <code>OrderDao</code> class.
                    It has a method <code>getOrder</code> that retrieves an order from the database. We can create a
                    mocked object of this class and force the <code>getOrder</code> method to return an Order without
                    ever hitting the database.</p>

                <h3>Why do we mock?</h3>
                <p>Mocking is essential for writing unit tests. A unit test is intended to test a single method of a
                    single class at a time. But why would we want to mock objects? How does this help us test the
                    functionality of a class? Most of the classes we write have dependencies. A dependency is when a
                    class in Java depends on an instance of another class. For example, if we create a card game with
                    the classes <code>Card</code> and <code>Deck</code>, the <code>Deck</code> class will have many
                    instances of the <code>Card</code> class, making the <code>Deck</code> class dependent on the
                    <code>Card</code> class. When we unit test methods from the <code>Deck</code> class, we're
                    unfortunately relying on the functionality of its dependencies; the <code>Card</code> class. This
                    isn't ideal. When unit testing, we want our unit tests to test just a single unit, not the unit and
                    the code it depends on.
                </p>
                <p>Keeping unit tests independent from dependencies also helps ensure a few different things. It makes
                    sure our tests are deterministic and capable of testing hard to reproduce use cases. We also want
                    tests to be fast, free, and clear of false alarms. We'll describe each of these benefits below.</p>
                <p>Deterministic tests always produce the same result from a given starting condition or initial state.
                    Consider an Alexa skill class that contains a method, <code>getTemperature</code>, to return the
                    temperature for a provided location. The Alexa skill class is dependent on the weather service
                    because it relies on it to get the current temperature. The <code>getTemperature</code> method
                    checks the user's preferences for the temperature scale (Fahrenheit or Celsius) and requests the
                    temperature from the weather service using the preferred scale. It then returns the temperature at
                    the requested location. A unit test might verify that when the <code>getTemperature</code> method is
                    asked for the temperature in Seattle by a user that prefers the Fahrenheit scale, it returns the
                    correct temperature. If we called the real weather service for each run of this unit test, the
                    results would always change like the weather in Seattle changes. This means we can't write a
                    deterministic unit test. We can't assert that the temperature returned is equal to anything! If we
                    did, it's likely our unit tests would constantly be failing.</p>
                <p>In the case of the Alexa skill class method, <code>getTemperature</code>, behaving correctly really
                    means requesting the temperature with the correct temperature scale from the weather service and
                    returning it. The temperature being correct is the job of the weather service. (It better have its
                    own unit tests!). So, we can mock the response from the weather service to ensure we write a
                    deterministic test. We can force the weather service to always return 75°F when it's asked for the
                    weather in Seattle by a user that prefers Fahrenheit. Then your unit tests can depend on this
                    behavior.</p>
                <p>With mocking, we can also test states that are hard to reproduce. For example, let's say we're
                    testing a home alarm system class. When the alarm system is triggered, the class makes three calls
                    to the alarm class to check if the homeowner has disabled the alarm. We want to test the case where
                    the first two times the alarm class was checked, the alarm was not disabled, but on the third call,
                    it was disabled by the customer. It will be tricky to set this situation up in our test class since
                    we need some external intervention at just the right time (the customer disabling). However, we need
                    to make sure this case works as it's important to prevent unnecessary calls to law enforcement. If
                    we use a mock alarm, we can mock the functionality that on the first two calls it returns not
                    disabled, but on the third call, it returns disabled.</p>
                <p>Mocking also ensures our tests are fast. Imagine we're trying to test an ATM class, which relies on a
                    bank connection. It can take up to 30 seconds to make a connection with the bank and let us know if
                    a customer has enough money in their account to make a withdrawal. This may be fine if we only have
                    one or two tests to run, but what if we have twenty tests to run using the bank connection! It will
                    take ten minutes every time we have to run our tests, which would be a debugging nightmare! Instead,
                    we can use a mock connection that returns a predetermined response and our tests will run in
                    seconds.</p>
                <p>Finally, mocking allows our tests to be free. Let's say we work on a service that uses a machine
                    learning model. Each time our service starts the machine learning algorithm, its dependency spins up
                    an expensive host, costing us about &#36;14/hour to run. If our model takes six hours to build,
                    we&apos;re spending &#36;84 each time our tests run! Mocking the dependency means that we never spin
                    up the expensive host costs and our tests are free to run! We also mentioned tests should be free of
                    false alarms. In the above home alarm system class, imagine what happens when the alarm is
                    triggered. Ideally, it should call the police. However, we don't want to call the police each time
                    we run our unit tests.</p>
                <p>You may be wondering when we test how these classes work together? Before we release it to our
                    customers, it seems like we'd want to know the whole system actually works and not just each
                    individual piece. You're right! That's called integration testing, and we'll cover it in a later
                    unit at ATA.</p>

                <h3>Example scenario</h3>
                <p>Now that we understand what mocking is and why we use it, let's talk about how we actually create a
                    mock! We're going to set up an example to show what mocking looks like in code.</p>
                <p>Imagine we work for a rental car company. In order to rent a car from the company, you need to be a
                    registered renter. For the purpose of this activity, a customer needs to have a valid driver's
                    license and be 18 or older to register. We created a class, <code>RenterRegistrar</code>, that has
                    two methods: <code>getRegisteredRenter()</code> and <code>registerRenter()</code>. The
                    <code>getRegisteredRenter()</code> method accepts a driver's license and returns the driver's
                    information if the license exists in the list of registered renters. If not, the method throws a
                    <code>NotRegisteredException</code>. The <code>registerRenter()</code> method accepts a driver,
                    checks their age, and checks to see if they have a valid driver's license. If they meet conditions,
                    they're added to the list of registered renters. If they don't, the method throws a
                    <code>NotEligibleToRegisterException</code>. The <code>RenterRegistrar</code> class looks like the
                    following:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
public class RenterRegistrar {

    private RenterDao renterDao;
    private DriverLicenseService driverLicenseService;

    public RenterRegistrar() {
        this.renterDao = new RenterDao(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());
        this.driverLicenseService = new DriverLicenseService();
    }

    public Driver getRegisteredRenter(String driverLicenseId) throws NotRegisteredException {
        return renterDao.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId);
    }

    public void registerRenter(Driver driver) throws NotEligibleToRegisterException {
        if (driver.getAge() &lt; 18) {
            throw new NotEligibleToRegisterException(driver.getName() + " is under 18.");
        }
        else if (!driverLicenseService.isValid(driver.getDriverLicenseId())) {
            throw new NotEligibleToRegisterException(driver.getName() + " doesn't have a valid drivers license.");
        }
        renterDao.addRenter(driver);
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>The <code>RenterRegistrar</code> class has two dependencies: <code>DriverLicenseService</code> and
                    <code>RenterDao</code>. The <code>DriverLicenseService</code> class has one method:
                    <code>isValid()</code>. This method checks to see whether a given driver's license ID is valid or
                    not. In an actual application, this method would likely connect to a driver's license database. For
                    the purpose of this activity, the method just checks to see if the given license ID is exactly 10
                    characters long. The <code>DriverLicenseService</code> class looks like the following:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
public class DriverLicenseService {

    public boolean isValid(String driverLicenseId) {
        return driverLicenseId.length() == 10;
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>The <code>RenterDao</code> class has two public methods: <code>getRegisteredRenter()</code> and
                    <code>addRenter()</code>. The <code>RenterDao</code> class also has an instance variable:
                    <code>renterList</code>, which is an <code>ArrayList</code> of type <code>Driver</code> that keeps
                    track of the people registered to rent a car. When given a driver's license id, the
                    <code>getRegisteredRenter()</code> method iterates through <code>renterList</code> to find a
                    specific <code>Driver</code>. If the driver's license id can't be found in <code>renterList</code>,
                    the method throws a <code>NotRegisteredException</code> instead. The <code>addRenter()</code> method
                    adds a given driver to the <code>renterList</code>. The <code>renterList</code> is persisted in a
                    file so that we can track renters across each run of the program. The <code>RenterDao</code> class
                    looks like the following:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">

    }

    public Driver getRegisteredRenter(String driverLicenseId) throws NotRegisteredException {
        if (!renterLicenseIdLookup.containsKey(driverLicenseId)) {
            throw new NotRegisteredException(String.format("Driver with licenseId: " +
                    "%s is not registered to rent a car.", driverLicenseId));
        }

        return renterLicenseIdLookup.get(driverLicenseId);
    }

    public void addRenter(Driver driver) throws RenterDatabaseNotAvailableException {
        if (!renterLicenseIdLookup.containsKey(driver.getDriverLicenseId())) {

                <p>We want to unit test the two methods in the <code>RenterRegistrar</code> class to make sure they're
                    functioning as we expect. To test the methods, we write a test class
                    <code>RenterRegistrarTest</code>. For the purpose of this activity we're going to focus on three
                    tests:

                <ul>
                    <li><code>getRegisteredRenter_registeredDriver_returnsDriver</code> validates the
                        <code>getRegisteredRenter</code> method returns the associated <code>Driver</code> when the
                        driver has already been registered
                    </li>
                    <li><code>getRegisteredRenter_unregisteredDriver_throwsNotRegisteredException</code> validates the
                        <code>isRegisteredRenter</code> method throws <code>NotRegisteredException</code> when the

                    </li>
                    <li><code>registerRenter_eligibleDriver_successfullyRegisters</code> validates that an
                        eligible-for-registration driver can successfully register</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our test class is defined below without mocking:</p>

                <h3>Creating Mocks</h3>
                <p>Our unit tests are set up and are currently using the actual implementations of
                    <code>DriverLicenseService</code> and <code>RenterDao</code>. There's a couple of pitfalls to doing
                    this! When we register a renter, the <code>RenterDao</code> actually stores it in the file,
                    persisting test data. Putting our test data into the real database means that our real data is
                    polluted and unreliable until we go in and clean it up. Additionally, the test could break if the
                    test data we use conflicts with a real driver being registered.
                </p>
                <p>When we test getting a registered driver, we also have to register the driver in the
                    <code>RenterDao</code> before we can run the test. Otherwise, we can't depend on the driver being
                    registered! This means we're no longer testing a "unit" of code; instead, we are testing both
                    methods, as a failure in either method would fail the test.
                </p>
                <p>However, we can switch to using mocks! As we said previously, we want to mock the objects that our
                    class under test is dependent on. Our class under test is <code>RenterRegistrar</code> and its
                    dependencies are <code>DriverLicenseService</code> and <code>RenterDao</code> so we want to mock
                    instances of those two classes.</p>
                <p>Java has a few different mocking frameworks, but we'll use Mockito. It's a popular mocking framework,
                    which can conveniently be used in conjunction with JUnit. The Mockito framework allows us to create
                    and configure mock objects. It greatly simplifies the development of tests for classes with external
                    dependencies.</p>
                <p>There are three things that we need to do to use Mockito in our unit tests:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mock the dependencies and insert the mocks into the test code</li>
                    <li>Execute the test code</li>
                    <li>Validate that the code executes as expected</li>
                </ol>
                <p>That's it! Let's start by discussing the first step: mock the dependencies and insert the mocks into
                    the test code. We start by adding the variable(s) we want to mock to our test class. To create
                    mocked instances of our dependencies <code>RenterDao</code> and <code>DriverLicenseService</code>,
                    we add them to our test class and annotate them with <code>@Mock</code>. This annotation is used to
                    create mocked instances. We've now added the following lines to the top of our test class:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
@Mock
private RenterDao renterDao;

@Mock
private DriverLicenseService driverLicenseService;
                </code></pre>
                <p>Now we have our mocked dependencies set up, there are still a few more things we need to do. Next,
                    we're going to add the <code>@InjectMocks</code> annotation above the class variable we're testing,
                    which is <code>RenterRegistrar</code>. We'll learn a bit more about injection in a later lesson, so
                    for now, consider <code>@InjectMocks</code> as a little bit of magic. Basically, it tells Mockito
                    this is the class that we want to swap out its real dependencies with mock dependencies. The mock
                    objects are passed to this class' constructor to create a new object. When we add in this
                    annotation, our <code>RenterRegistrar</code> instance declaration looks like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
@InjectMocks
private RenterRegistrar renterRegistrar;
                </code></pre>
                <p>The final step is to update our <code>setup()</code> method, which creates the class under test
                    object. We will remove creating a new <code>RenterRegistrar</code> using its constructor, and
                    instead call a Mockito method, <code>initMocks()</code>. It's a static method that initializes the
                    mocks for this test class object (anything annotated with <code>@Mock</code>) by passing in the
                    keyword <code>this</code>. It then creates an object of the class under test (annotated with
                    <code>@InjectMocks</code>), injecting it with the mock objects. The <code>@BeforeEach</code>
                    annotation that we use states that the <code>renterRegistrar</code> object and its mocks will be
                    recreated at the start of every test method. This is a best practice to prevent tests from
                    interfering with each other. Our <code>setup()</code> method now looks like the following:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
@BeforeEach
public void setup() {
    initMocks(this);
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Now our mocked dependencies are set up! Let's look at all the changes we made together:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
public class RenterRegistrarTest {

    @InjectMocks
    private RenterRegistrar renterRegistrar;

    @Mock
    private RenterDao renterDao;

    @Mock
    private DriverLicenseService driverLicenseService;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {
        initMocks(this);
    }

    //...test methods
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Before we wrap up this reading, there's one more issue with our code to resolve. The constructor of
                    the class we're testing, <code>RenterRegistrar</code>, currently looks like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
public RenterRegistrar() {
    this.renterDao = new RenterDao();
    this.driverLicenseService = new DriverLicenseService();
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>When we initialize the instance of <code>renterRegistrar</code> in our test class, the above
                    constructor creates new instances of <code>RenterDao</code> and <code>DriverLicenseService</code>
                    even though we'll use the mocked versions we created in our test class. Mockito is actually smart
                    enough to still use the mocked versions. If the constructor doesn't have any parameters, Mockito can
                    still figure it out. However, this might confuse readers of our code because we're creating objects
                    we'll never use. It's a good design to accept our dependencies via our constructor instead of
                    creating them in the constructor, as we learned from Dependency Injection.</p>
                <p>To fix this issue, we'll update our constructor to instead accept an instance of
                    <code>RenterDao</code> and <code>DriverLicenseService</code>.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
public RenterRegistrar(RenterDao renterDao, DriverLicenseService driversLicenseService) {
    this. renterDao = renterDao;
    this.driverLicenseService = driversLicenseService;
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>In our test class, we don't need to make any adjustments. However, Mockito will now use our
                    constructor to pass the mocked objects to our object under test, rather than going about it in a
                    more hacky way.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>In this reading, we introduced the concept of mocking in unit tests to avoid relying on dependencies
                    when testing a class. We also learned about Mockito, which is a popular mocking framework that can
                    conveniently be used in conjunction with JUnit. With our car rental registration application, we set
                    up a code example to demonstrate how to mock dependencies using <code>@Mock</code>. We provided them
                    to our object under test by using <code>@InjectMocks</code>, and we triggered Mockito to set
                    everything up using <code>initMocks</code>. We also discussed refactoring our code so that a
                    constructor accepts its dependencies through its constructor.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>In a previous lesson, we introduced unit testing to assess the methods in our classes. Sometimes the
                    classes we want to test are tightly intertwined with the functionality of other classes. This can
                    make our unit testing complicated. We might not be able to test all the precise test conditions we
                    desire. In this lesson, we're going to introduce mocking. Mock objects are dummy implementations of
                    our dependencies that allow us to define the output of their method calls.</p>
                <p>In the first reading, we introduced mocking concepts and why we want to use them. We set up an
                    example we'll use throughout this lesson to show mocking in code. At the end of the reading, we had
                    our mock and test objects set up.<br>In the second reading, we'll continue using our mocking example
                    to show how to write deterministic tests. We'll explore how to determine what to mock and how to
                    turn that logic into code. We'll also discuss additional methods that give greater flexibility over
                    our deterministic tests and outputs.</p>

                <h3>Defining behavior</h3>
                <p>In the last reading, we covered mocking dependencies, but we didn't update our actual unit tests to
                    use the mocks! If we tried to run our unit tests now, some would fail and some will run into
                    exceptions. Unless otherwise specified, mock objects will return default values when their methods
                    are called. For Java objects, the default value is null. For the primitive type boolean, it's false.
                    You can use Oracle's documentation to review the default return values for each primitive type<a
                        href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Links to an external site.</a>. So, when
                    isValid is called on our mock DriverLicenseService object, regardless of the input, it returns
                    false.</p>
                <p>So how do we specify the values we want instead of just using the default values? To guarantee
                    deterministic results for our tests, we need to tell our mocks how to behave. We can tell our mocks
                    that when they see a certain method called with a certain input, then they should return a certain
                    output. This helps us test the functionality of our methods without worrying about the behavior of
                    the dependencies.</p>
                <p>The first thing we need to determine is what to mock. Let's look at our first test method again:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
    @Test
    public void getRegisteredRenter_registeredDriver_returnsDriver() throws RenterDatabaseNotAvailableException, NotEligibleToRegisterException, NotRegisteredException {
        // GIVEN
        String driverLicenseId = "1234ABC567";
        Driver driver = new Driver("Danica Patrick", 38, driverLicenseId);
        renterRegistrar.registerRenter(driver);

        // WHEN
        Driver registeredRenter = renterRegistrar.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId);

        // THEN
        assertEquals(driver.getName(), registeredRenter.getName());
        assertEquals(driver.getAge(), registeredRenter.getAge());
        assertEquals(driver.getDriverLicenseId(), registeredRenter.getDriverLicenseId());
    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>By looking at the title of the method, we know that our test case validates that when a registered
                    driver's license id is passed to getRegisteredRenter() it should return the Driver. So, we want the
                    driver's license id we pass in to getRegisteredRenter() to correspond with someone who's already
                    registered to rent a car.</p>
                <p>Let's look at the method under test:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
    public Driver getRegisteredRenter(String driverLicenseId) throws NotRegisteredException {
        return renterDao.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId);
    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>Looking at the method, in order to have the driver's license we pass in correspond to someone who is
                    already registered to rent a car, we need renterDAO.getRegisteredRenter() to return without throwing
                    an exception.</p>
                <p>Finally, let's look at the renterDAO.getRegisteredRenter() method header to see what it should
                    return:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
Driver getRegisteredRenter(String driverLicenseId) throws NotRegisteredException
                </code></pre>
                <p>We see that we need to return the driver that corresponds to the provided driver's license id.</p>
                <p>Following the pattern we previously mentioned, we want to tell our mock that when it sees
                    renterDAO.getRegisteredRenter() called with a certain input, then it should return a Driver
                    instance. We can use the Mockito methods when() and thenReturn() to mock the behavior of our
                    RenterDao.</p>
                <p>The line of code looks like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
when(renterDao.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId)).thenReturn(driver);
                </code></pre>
                <p>We pass getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId), because that's the value we expect to be passed to the
                    method. The method under test will be called with driverLicenseId, and then will call
                    getRegisteredRenter with that same value. (Warning: If you provide the wrong input when setting up
                    the mock's when method, Mockito will not return the value provided to the thenReturn method. Mockito
                    will instead return the default since the mocked behavior we set up never actually occurred.)</p>
                <p>Without mocking, we were setting up a registered driver in our GIVEN section by making a call to
                    register the renter:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
renterRegistrar.registerRenter(driver);
                </code></pre>
                <p>Instead, we can replace that line with our new mocked behavior. Now we don't actually have to
                    register a driver for our tests to work.</p>
                <p>We have one last change to make. When calling renterRegistrar.registerRenter() we had to handle the
                    checked exception it threw, NotEligibleToRegisterException. We removed this call, so we can remove
                    this exception from the throws clause. The call we are mocking, renterDao.getRegisteredRenter() also
                    throws a checked exception, NotRegisteredException. We'll need to add that to the throws clause too.
                    Our first test method passes now and looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
@Test
public void getRegisteredRenter_registeredDriver_returnsDriver() throws NotRegisteredException {
    // GIVEN
    String driverLicenseId = "1234ABC567";
    Driver driver = new Driver("Danica Patrick", 38, driverLicenseId);
    when(renterDao.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId)).thenReturn(driver);

    // WHEN
    Driver registeredRenter = renterRegistrar.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId);

    // THEN
    assertEquals(driver.getName(), registeredRenter.getName());
    assertEquals(driver.getAge(), registeredRenter.getAge());
    assertEquals(driver.getDriverLicenseId(), registeredRenter.getDriverLicenseId());
}
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Defining exceptional behavior</h3>
                <p>Sometimes instead of returning a value, our mocked behavior will need to throw an exception. For
                    example, let's take a look at our second unit test:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
@Test
public void getRegisteredRenter_unregisteredDriver_throwsNotRegisteredException() {
    // GIVEN
    String driverLicenseId = "ABC1234567";

    // WHEN
    // THEN
    assertThrows(NotRegisteredException.class,
            () -> renterRegistrar.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId));
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Looking at the title of this method, we know our test case validates that when an unregistered
                    driver's license id is passed to getRegisteredRenter() it should throw a NotRegisteredException. So,
                    we want the driver's license we pass in to not belong to a registered renter.</p>
                <p>Let's once again look at the method we're testing:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
public Driver getRegisteredRenter(String driverLicenseId) {
    return renterDao.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId);
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>For the getRegisteredRenter() method to throw the NotRegisteredException, the
                    renterDao.getRegisteredRenter() method must throw a NotRegisteredException.</p>
                <p>Using a very similar process to above, we tell our mock that when it sees
                    renterDAO.getRegisteredRenter() called with a certain input, then it should throw a
                    NotRegisteredException. Notice that in this test we want to throw an exception instead of return a
                    value. We can use the Mockito methods when() and thenThrow() to mock the behavior of our RenterDao.
                </p>
                <p>This highlights a great advantage of mocking. We didn't have to worry about the specific conditions
                    that would cause a NotRegisteredException, and set up data to make the exception occur. We simply
                    have to say, please throw this exception when you see a certain driver's license id.</p>
                <p>The line of code looks like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
when(renterDao.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId)).thenThrow(NotRegisteredException.class);
                </code></pre>
                <p>Again, we pass getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId), because that's the value we expect to be passed
                    to the method. The method under test will be called with driverLicenseId, and then will call
                    getRegisteredRenter with that same value.</p>
                <p>Once again, we need to add throws NotRegisteredException to the method signature since
                    renterDao.getRegisteredRenter() throws this checked exception. This line of code should be added to
                    the GIVEN portion of our test.</p>
                <p>The full unit test looks like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
@Test
public void getRegisteredRenter_unregisteredDriver_throwsNotRegisteredException() throws NotRegisteredException {
    // GIVEN
    String driverLicenseId = "ABC1234567";
    when(renterDao.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId)).thenThrow(NotRegisteredException.class);

    // WHEN
    // THEN
    assertThrows(NotRegisteredException.class,
            () -> renterRegistrar.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId));
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>The syntax changes slightly when we want to mock an exception being thrown from a void method. For
                    example, imagine the RenterDao instead had a method void validateDriver(String driverLicenseId) that
                    instead of returning a value, threw an exception if the id could not be found and otherwise returned
                    successfully. Instead of using thenThrow(), we would use the Mockito method doThrow() and chain on
                    the when() method. The other difference is that we specify the method to be called on the mock (in
                    this case validateDriver()) outside of the when() method instead of as part of the parameters.</p>
                <p>This line of code would look like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
doThrow(NotRegisteredException.class).when(renterDAO).validateDriver(driverLicenseId);
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Verifying behavior</h3>
                <p>Let's take a look at our third unit test method:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
@Test
public void registerRenter_eligibleDriver_successfullyRegisters() throws NotEligibleToRegisterException, RenterDatabaseNotAvailableException, NotRegisteredException {
    // GIVEN
    String driverLicenseId = "1234ABC567";
    Driver driver = new Driver("Danica Patrick", 38, driverLicenseId);

    // WHEN
    renterRegistrar.registerRenter(driver);

    // THEN
    Driver registeredRenter = renterRegistrar.getRegisteredRenter(driverLicenseId);
    assertEquals(driver.getName(), registeredRenter.getName());
    assertEquals(driver.getAge(), registeredRenter.getAge());
    assertEquals(driver.getDriverLicenseId(), registeredRenter.getDriverLicenseId());
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Looking at the name of this method, we know that our test case validates that when an eligible driver
                    is passed to registerRenter() it should successfully register the given driver. So, we want the
                    driver we pass in to registerRenter() to correspond with someone who is allowed to register.</p>
                <p>Let's look at the method we're testing:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
public void registerRenter(Driver driver) throws NotEligibleToRegisterException {
    if (driver.getAge() < 18) {
        throw new NotEligibleToRegisterException(driver.getName() + " is under 18.");
    }
    else if (!driverLicenseService.isValid(driver.getDriverLicenseId())) {
        throw new NotEligibleToRegisterException(driver.getName() + " doesn't have a valid drivers license.");
    }
    renterDao.addRenter(driver);
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>This method is a bit more complex than the previous one we tested. As you can see, this method is
                    dependent on a method from both driverLicenseService and renterDao. The registerRenter() method
                    successfully registers a person when they are 18 or older and their driver's license is valid. For a
                    driver's license to be valid, it must return true when passed into the
                    driverLicenseService.isValid() method. Once a person passes both those tests, they can then
                    successfully register using the renterDAO.addRenter() method.</p>
                <p>Let's first look at the driverLicenseService.isValid() method header to see what it should return:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
boolean isValid(String driverLicenseId)
                </code></pre>
                <p>Looking at this method, we can see that it returns true when a driver's license is valid, false
                    otherwise. We want to tell our mock that when it sees driverLicenseService.isValid() called with a
                    certain input, then it should return true. The certain input should be the driver's license id of
                    the driver passed to our method under test. We can add the line below to our GIVEN section to mock
                    this behavior.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
when(driverLicenseService.isValid(driverLicenseId)).thenReturn(true);
                </code></pre>
                <p>Next, we need to look at the renterDao.addRenter() method signature:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
void addRenter(Driver driver)
                </code></pre>
                <p>Looking at this method, we can see that it's void and doesn't return anything. Since nothing is being
                    returned, we can't use the thenReturn() method. Instead, we'll verify that the method gets called
                    when our method under test is called.</p>
                <p>What we care about here is that the addRenter() method is called and that it's called with the right
                    input. In this case, the correct input is the driver we initially passed to the registerRenter()
                    method.</p>
                <p>To verify the addRenter() method is called with the right input, we use the Mockito verify() method.
                    We chain the method we're checking (in this case addRenter()) on to the verify() method and pass in
                    the expected input.</p>
                <p>This line of code looks like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
verify(renterDao).addRenter(driver);
                </code></pre>
                <p>Verifications go in the THEN section of our test. We can only verify that an interaction with a mock
                    occurred after we call the method that causes the interactions. In this case,
                    renterRegistrar.registerRenter() needs to be called for the call to renterDao.addRenter() to occur.
                    We can replace our assertTrue statement with this verification statement. To validate that
                    renterRegistrar.registerRenter() is correct, we only need to verify that it calls the RenterDao to
                    add our driver. Since we are using mocks though, the driver won't actually be persisted in the
                    RenterDao, so our previous assert statement won't be very valuable.</p>
                <p>The full unit test looks like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
@Test
public void registerRenter_eligibleDriver_successfullyRegisters() throws NotEligibleToRegisterException {
    // GIVEN
    String driverLicenseId = "1234ABC567";
    Driver driver = new Driver("Danica Patrick", 38, driverLicenseId);
    when(driverLicenseService.isValid(driverLicenseId)).thenReturn(true);

    // WHEN
    renterRegistrar.registerRenter(driver);

    // THEN
    verify(renterDao).addRenter(driver);
}
                </code></pre>

                <h4>Overloaded verify method</h4>
                <p>The verify() method also has an overloaded method that allows us to set a VerificationMode. There are
                    numerous VerificationMode static methods. A common method is times(), which tracks the number of
                    times we call a method. We could verify that the addRenter() method is only called one time with the
                    following line of code:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
verify(renterDao, times(1)).addRenter(driver);
                </code></pre>
                <p>If times(X) is not provided, verify will default to verifying the method was called once.</p>
                <p>We can also use the verifyZeroInteractions() method, which verifies that none of a mock's methods
                    were called. For example, in our first and second unit tests, we could ensure that no methods from
                    the driverLicenseService mock were called with:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
verifyZeroInteractions(driverLicenseService);
                </code></pre>
                <p>Some other common VerificationMode methods are:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
// Check to make sure this method with this input was called >= wantedNumberOfInvocations times:
atLeast(int wantedNumberOfInvocations)

// Check to make sure this method with this input was called <= wantedNumberOfInvocations times:
atMost(int wantedNumberOfInvocations)

//Check to make sure this method with this input was called >= 1 times:
atLeastOnce()

//Check to make sure this method with this input was never called:
never()
                </code></pre>

                <h3>What not to mock</h3>
                <p>Now we've taught you how to mock and why, but it's also important to understand what not to mock.
                    Mocking is very effective, but only when used correctly. We want to make sure that we're mocking
                    roles not objects. The role is the interface whereas the object is the implementation of the
                    interface. If our class has a dependency on an interface type, we want to mock the interface, not
                    the implementation that our class uses.</p>
                <p>We always need to make sure we don't mock code that we don't understand. Mocks allow us to describe
                    the behavior of other code. If we describe that behavior incorrectly or incompletely, we can't
                    verify that code works in real conditions. If we don't understand all the parts and pieces of the
                    code, we may not be able to verify the code works in all conditions. In general, only mock code we
                    understand well, such as code we own. We only mock code's well-documented behavior, and we don't
                    mock code without a reason.</p>
                <p>Avoid mocking collection classes such as List and Map. Collection classes often include hidden
                    behaviors we can't mock or aren't fully documented. These classes are normally well tested anyways,
                    so there shouldn't be a reason for us to mock them.</p>
                <p>Lastly, probably don't mock POJOs. This is debated in the I.T. community, but most companies,
                    generally, don't mock POJOs. The purpose of mocking is to hide another class' business logic and
                    focus on functionality. POJOs shouldn't have business logic and therefore shouldn't require mocking.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>In this reading, we covered writing deterministic tests by using mocks to force dependable behavior
                    from our dependencies. We mapped out the logic for determining what to mock for each unit test, and
                    how to turn that into code. We also learned about matchers, which allow us to mock even when we
                    don't know the exact value being passed into a method. Finally, we discussed what not to mock.
                    Mocking is a powerful tool that can help save time and money when testing, while also providing
                    control over our test conditions.</p>
