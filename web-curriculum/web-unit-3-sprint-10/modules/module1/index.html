        <h3>Finite State Machines</h3>
        <p>Mutable objects are objects whose state is allowed to change over time. An immutable value is an exact
          opposite; after it has been created, it can never change. There are some real benefits from making your state
          immutable. We won't go over all the benefits here, but we will talk about predictability and avoiding
          mutation.</p>
        <p>Mutation hides change, which can create unexpected side effects. This can lead to some nasty bugs in our
          code. When we enforce immutability, we can keep our application architecture and mental model simple, making
          it easier to reason about the application. Simply put, it is very easy to predict how the state object will
          change based on certain actions/events. Without immutability, our state object can be changed or updated in
          unpredictable ways, causing weird behavior or bugs.</p>

        <h3>How to Build It</h3>
        <p>You should know that numbers and strings are immutable types of data. A number cannot magically turn into a
          different number. If the number is held inside a variable declared with <code>let</code>, then this variable
          can be reassigned to a different number, creating the illusion that the number itself is changing. The same
          goes for strings: strings are immutable: once declared, a string never changes. Methods like
          <code>toUpperCase</code> just return a brand new string.</p>
        <p>Objects are different. These are mutable data structures! By default, in JavaScript we can add, overwrite and
          delete the properties of any object. The object itself is the same object, but its shape suffers mutations if
          we perform those kinds of operations. This is part of what makes JavaScript so flexible and dynamic, but it
          can also be a source of bugs in certain scenarios, when an object unexpectedly changes shape.</p>
        <p>In functional programming, and when working with React and Redux, we try to avoid mutating objects. The
          spread operator comes in handy for creating copies of objects to avoid mutating in place the original ones:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
const obj = { name: 'Pam', age: 34 }
// obj.age = 35 // CAREFUL! This would mutate the original object in place
const obj2 = { ...obj, age: 35 } // Copy with a modification, preserving the original
                </code></pre>

        <p>This preserves the original object. It must be noted that a copy built like this is a shallow copy. The
          spread operator won't recursively copy mutable structures nested inside the object. If a property of an
          original object contains another object, creating a shallow copy means that the nested object is one and the
          same for both original and copy. Suppose we wish to increase the age of a user nested inside an object,
          without mutating the object:</p>

        <pre><code>
const data = { id: 7, user: { name: 'John', age: 45 } } // How can we increase the age?
const newData = { ...data } // Shallow copy
newData.user.age = 46       // Mutating data, falsely believing the original data.user is safe
newData.user.age // Evaluates to 46 like we wanted...
data.user.age    // Oh, no! This also evaluates to 46. We mutated the original!
                </code></pre>

        <p>Luckily it's easy to modify our technique to avoid mutating the original user:</p>

        <pre><code>
const data = { id: 7, user: { name: 'John', age: 45 } }
const newData = { ...data, user: { ...data.user, age: 46 } } // A birthday without mutations
                </code></pre>

        <p>Arrays in JavaScript are also mutable data structures. Many array methods, like <code>push</code>,
          <code>pop</code> or <code>splice</code> are destructive, in the sense that they mutate the array on which the
          method is called. Other methods are non-destructive and return a new array without damaging the original one,
          like <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code> and <code>concat</code>. The spread operator also comes in handy,
          if we wish to add elements to an array without causing any mutations:</p>

        <pre><code>
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
const arr2 = arr1.concat(4)
const arr3 = [...arr2, 5]

arr1 // Evaluates to [1, 2, 3]
arr2 // Evaluates to [1, 2, 3, 4]
arr3 // Evaluates to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                </code></pre>

        <p>In conclusion, whenever you are working with an array or an object, ask yourself whether the operation you're
          performing is destructive or non-destructive! Depending on the situation, you might wish to avoid causing
          mutations.</p>

        <h3>Creating Reducers</h3>

        <p>Reducer functions take two arguments: the current state and and an action. Then, a new, updated state object
          based on both arguments is returned.</p>
        <p>In pseudocode, this looks like this:</p>

        <pre><code>
(state, action) => newState
                </code></pre>

        <p>This seemingly simple idea is going to allow us to clean up our React components, by removing state
          calculations from them. Reducers also will unlock the ability to create extremely complex applications, beyond
          what we would be able to achieve with the State hook alone.</p>

        <h3>How to Build It</h3>

        <p>Consider a function in JavaScript that, when passed to an integer, would return that value + 1, without
          mutating the original integer's value. Notice we could pass our initialState value - 0 - and then return a new
          value - 1 - without overriding the initialState.</p>

        <pre><code>
const initialState = 0
const reducer = (state) => {
  const newState = state + 1
  return newState;
}

const newStateValue = reducer(initialState);
console.log(initialState, newStateValue); // 0, 1
                </code></pre>

        <p>Often, returning something such as an integer or a string is not the best choice, especially as data grows
          more complex.</p>
        <p>Let's consider instead using an object as the data structure of choice for state:</p>

        <pre><code>
const initialState = { count: 0 }
const reducer = (state) => {
  return { count: state.count + 1 }
}
                </code></pre>

        <p>Again, we are returning a new object and are not directly mutating or overriding the
          <code>initialState</code> object.</p>
        <p>This reducer function is a pure function without any side effects. Therefore, reducer functions are the
          perfect fit for managing changes in state in an immutable manner.</p>
        <p>We've discussed the nature of the incoming state value, but what about the action?</p>
        <p>The action, represented by an object, contains information related to some action that happens in our app.
          Every action object is required to have a <code>type</code> property, which will tell the reducer what's going
          on inside the app. Specifically, the <code>type</code> allows the reducer to know what parts of the state need
          to change.</p>
        <p>Fleshing out the reducer above a bit more, let's notify the reducer that we want to increment our count state
          by passing in an <code>action</code> with <code>'increment'</code> as the type.</p>

        <pre><code>
const initialState = { count: 0 }
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'increment') {
    return { count: state.count + 1 }
  }
}

const nextState = reducer(initialState, { type: 'increment' })
                </code></pre>

        <p>This strategy is especially powerful when we want our reducer to be able to reduce the state. Let's flesh it
          out a bit more, by adding more cases:</p>

        <pre><code>
const initialState = { count: 0 }
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'increment') {
    return { count: state.count + 1 }
  }
  if (action.type === 'decrement') {
    return { count: state.count - 1 }
  }
}

const state1 = reducer(initialState, { type: 'increment' }) // state1 is {count:1}
const state2 = reducer(state1, { type: 'increment' }) // state2 is {count:2}
const state3 = reducer(state2, { type: 'decrement' }) // state3 is {count:1}
                </code></pre>

        <p>Now our state management is very predictable!</p>
        <p>We can also add a <code>payload</code> property to our action objects (sometimes called <code>data</code>).
          Sometimes our reducer needs to have some extra information passed into it through the action, to be able to
          update the state correctly, and this is where that data would live.</p>

        <pre><code>
const initialState = { name: 'Donald Duck' }
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'changeName') {
    // how do we know what to change the name to? The action payload!
    return { name: action.payload }
  }
}

const nextState = reducer(initialState, { type: 'changeName', payload: 'Mickey Mouse' });
                </code></pre>

        <p>There's one last edit we need to make to get to production quality. As you can imagine, <code>if</code>,
          <code>if else</code>, … etc, statements are going to get very complex and long. We'll use JavaScript's
          <code>switch</code> statement to make that part of our reducer a lot more readable:</p>
        <p>Back to the count example, look at the change here:</p>

        <pre><code>
const initialState = { count: 0 }
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 }
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 }
    default: // this is in case the action type is unknown!
      return state
  }
}

const state1 = reducer(initialState, { type: 'increment' })
const state2 = reducer(state1, { type: 'decrement' })
                </code></pre>

        <p>(Read more about switch statements <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</p>
        <p>It's very important that reducers be deterministic: for the same arguments it should always return the same
          value. We should not mutate state directly nor cause any other side effects. There should be no randomness
          happening inside the reducer: a reducer is not the place to generate a random id, for example, as the function
          would not be deterministic anymore. And we must always return state. Do not forget to add a default case to
          your switch!</p>
        <p>In conclusion, reducers will allow us to extract uncomfortable state recalculations out of components, so
          that components can focus on rendering UI, which is what they do best.</p>

        <h3>Using the Reducer Hook</h3>

        <p>The Reducer hook is an alternative to the State hook. It is preferable when you have complex logic that you
          have to deal with in a component, or when you find yourself with a lot of state properties in a single
          component. <code>useReducer</code>, takes in a <code>reducer</code> function (which we build), as well as a
          value for the <code>initialState</code>. Then it returns both the current state and a dispatch function that
          allows to modify state, similar to what the State hook does:</p>

        <pre><code>
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
                </code></pre>

        <p>The <code>dispatch</code> function is a significant addition to our arsenal here. It will send an action to
          our reducer when specific events occur in our application. The dispatch allows us to leverage the reducer
          function from our previous section to maintain our state at the level of the component.</p>

        <p>The <code>useReducer</code> hook has all the functionality we love from the <code>useState</code> hook and
          combines it with the power of the reducers we are building ourselves. In doing so, it provides access to both
          the state and a function that dispatch actions to our reducer.</p>

        <h3>How to Build It</h3>

        <p>Let's build out a component to go along with our counter reducer. Please pay attention to the comments in the
          code that will walk us through this process:</p>

        <pre><code>
import React, { useReducer } from 'react' // import the hook

// decide what the initial state looks like
const initialState = { count: 0, /* other slices of state */ }

// build a reducer
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREASE':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 }
    case 'DECREASE':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 }
    // likely there will be many other cases
    default: // do not forget your default case
      return state
  }
}

export default function Counter() {
  // use the hook at the top of the component,
  // passing it the reducer and the initial state
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  return (
    <>
      {/* `state` holds all the slices of state, like `count` */}
      &lt;div className="count"&gt;Count: {state.count}&lt;/div&gt;

      {/* `dispatch` alerts the reducer that the state must be recalculated */}
      &lt;button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREASE' })}&gt;+1&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREASE' })}&gt;-1&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/>
  )
}
                </code></pre>

        <p>The Reducer hook might be overkill in a component with such simple state, but it's a lifesaver when things
          start getting complicated. The reducer function may be put in a separate file, for easier maintenance, and to
          keep the component it powers a bit neater.</p>
