            <h2>Module Overview</h2>
            <p>In this module, we're going to build on the descriptive statistics concepts we've already learned about
                as we started to explore our data. This module will introduce the idea of a "hypothesis test" and how we
                implement one, specifically using the t-test and t-distributions. We'll also cover how to calculate
                p-values and use the results to interpret our hypothesis.</p>
            <p>In addition, this module will cover one of the most important concepts in statistics: the Central Limit
                Theorem. We'll learn about the properties of sampling distributions and how to interpret the expected
                mean of a sample distribution, which will, in turn, lead to the idea of confidence intervals and how we
                know the confidence level of our results and predictions.</p>

            <h2>Objective 01 - Explain the Purpose of a t-test and Identify Applications</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Before we learn about t-tests, we should cover some more basic information about the concept of
                hypothesis testing first. When interpreting our data or results, we want to confirm or reject an
                assumption about that data or result. This assumption can also be called a hypothesis. So, before we
                interpret our results (hopefully), we will have stated our hypothesis. Then, we need to test it to
                determine at what confidence level we know our results. Hypothesis tests are also known as significance
                tests, meaning we want to know how significant our result is.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we use statistical methods to test our hypothesis, we're conducting a statistical hypothesis test.
                There are several different statistical tests we can do. For this objective, we're going to be focusing
                on t-tests. They make use of a statistical distribution called the Student's t-distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, before we get into the t-distribution, a refresher of the normal distribution will be helpful.
            </p>

            <h3>Normal distribution</h3>
            <p>
                The normal probability distribution comes up very frequently in the study of probability and statistics.
                A variable that has a normal distribution is one where the mean = median = mode. A normal distribution
                is theoretical, which means that in nature, nothing will strictly follow this distribution. But many
                variables approximate to it, such as the height of adult humans, birth weight of human babies, height of
                the same variety of pine trees.
            </p>
            <p>
                The normal distribution is known as a bell curve because it has the shape of a bell. Using the numpy
                normal distribution, we can draw a sample population with a specified mean (center point of the "bell")
                and standard deviation (width or "spread" of the curve), and plot it.
            </p>
            <pre><code>import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# The mean of a normal distribution can be any value
# (we're using 0 for plotting nicely and to see the symmetry)
mean = 0

# The width of the normal distribution is set by the standard deviation
sigma = 1

# Create a sample drawn from the normal distribution
sample = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=sigma, size=1000)

# Create the fig and axes object and plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))
ax = sns.displot(sample)
ax.set_titles('The normal distribution', fontsize=16)

fig.clf()
</code></pre>
            <img src="download.png" alt="Normal distribution plot" loading="lazy">
            <p>
                In the plot, we can see a nice bell shape, centered on the mean we specified as 0 and with a standard
                deviation of the sample equal to 1.
            </p>

            <h3>The z-score</h3>
            <p>
                In statistics, we also use something called the z-score. Say, for example, you take a value at random
                from the distribution above. We can calculate a z-score for that value which describes its position in
                terms of the distance from the mean when measured in standard deviation units. Z-scores may be positive
                or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score below the
                mean. For example, a z-score of 1 means the value you chose is one standard deviation from the mean.
            </p>

            <h3>The t-values and t-tests</h3>
            <p>
                In some situations, we have to draw a sample from a population whose mean is unknown. What if for the
                normal distribution plotted above, and we had set the mean equal to one?
            </p>
            <p>
                In such scenarios, we use the sample's mean instead. When we use the mean of the sample and not the mean
                of the population from which we drew the sample, we calculate the t-value. This value is similar to the
                z-score but we use the mean of the sample instead of the population to calculate it.
            </p>
            <p>
                A t-test is based on a t-value. When you perform a t-test for a single study, you obtain a single
                t-value. If you drew lots of random samples of the same size from the same population, performed a
                t-test each time (to obtain a t-value), you could then plot a distribution of all the t-values. This
                type of distribution is called a sampling distribution and, in this case, a t-distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to math and statisticians, the properties of t-distributions are well understood, so we can plot
                them without having to draw samples, calculate the t-value, etc. A specific t-distribution is defined by
                its degrees of freedom (dof), with a sample size-1. So there is a whole "family" of t-distributions for
                every sample size. For large samples size (n &gt; 120), the shape of the t-distribution is almost
                identical to the normal distribution. For smaller sample sizes, the t-distribution is much flatter in
                the middle. In the next section, we'll look at the t-distribution graphically.
            </p>

            <h3>When to use a t-test?</h3>
            <p>
                There are a few situations where using a t-test is useful. In this lesson, we will be focusing on two:
            </p>
            <h4>One-sample t-test</h4>
            <p>
                One of the most common one-sample t-tests is to determine the statistical difference between a sample
                mean and a known or hypothesized value of the mean in the population. For example, say we want to
                compare the average Netflix watching time for a specific group of viewers, such as ages 5-12 (mean value
                of the sample), and compare it to the average Netflix time for the US population (mean value for the
                population from the sample ). Then, we perform a t-test to determine how effective the mean of the
                sample is in comparison to the general population - does this age group watch significantly more or less
                Netflix? Or is it not statistically different?
            </p>
            <h4>Two-sample t-test (also called an independent t-test)</h4>
            <p>
                A two-sample t-test is helpful if we want to compare the mean of two samples and determine if a property
                is true. example, say you want to know if the mean petal length of iris flowers differs according to
                their species. So you measure 25 petals of each species and then test the difference between these two
                groups using a t-test.
            </p>

            <h3>Follow Along</h3>
            <p>
                We've covered the concepts of distributions and t-values. Now, we can look at some graphical
                representations of these distributions. In the following plot, we created t-distributions with varying
                degrees of freedom. We can see that the t-distribution with the smallest number of degrees of freedom is
                flatter in the middle and "wider" on the sides. As the sample size increases (degrees of freedom
                increase), the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution (plotted in black).
            </p>
            <pre><code># Import the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create the t-distributions
t_df10 = np.random.standard_t(df=10, size=100)
t_df100 = np.random.standard_t(df=100, size=1000)
t_df1000 = np.random.standard_t(df=1000, size=10000)

# Create the normal distribution
s = np.random.normal(size=10000)

# Create the figure and axes objects and plots
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)

# Plot t-distributions
ax = sns.kdeplot(t_df10, color='r');
ax = sns.kdeplot(t_df100, color='y');
ax = sns.kdeplot(t_df1000, color='b');

# Plot normal distributions
sns.kdeplot(s, color='k');
