            <h2>Module 1 Practice</h2>
            <p>Now it's time to practice what you learned in this module!</p>

            <p>If you have not done so already, create an account on LinkedIn. If you already have a LinkedIn profile,
                now is the time to refine it and make it career-ready for a tech job.</p>

            <p>Use the resume that you created in the last sprint to help you complete your LinkedIn profile. The
                information in your resume and LinkedIn profile should match.</p>

            <p>Start by completing the Core sections of your LinkedIn profile, then add a few Recommended sections such
                as "featured" or "licenses and certifications". Lastly, add more personality to your profile, by adding
                sections from Additional (for example "projects", would be a good one to include).</p>

            <p>As you progress through the program and get to the Applied Computer Science unit, you will have an
                opportunity to receive personalized feedback on all your career artifacts (GitHub, Resume, and
                LinkedIn). It is important for you to complete a quality draft version of your LinkedIn profile during
                this sprint.</p>

            <p>You are strongly encouraged to attend a live Get it Done session for additional support in creating your
                LinkedIn profile. Visit the BloomTech Portal for the Get it Done session schedule.</p>

            <p>At a bare minimum, complete the following, before you submit your LinkedIn profile as part of the Sprint
                Challenge. But the more sections you can add, the better!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>About Section</li>
                <li>Profile picture</li>
                <li>Headline</li>
                <li>Skills</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Projects</li>
                <li>Experience</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Now it's time to take the GCA!</h2>

                knowledge. It is designed to help you determine if you are ready for the Applied Computer Science unit.
