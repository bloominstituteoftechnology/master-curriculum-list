            <p>What is a web application? It's a pretty overloaded term, but in general, refers to any sort of useful
                interactive tool you can load in a web browser. In this module, we'll break down the specific components
                of a web application, and learn how to develop our own basic web application using the Flask Python
                framework.</p>

            <h2>Objective 01 - Distinguish between front-end, back-end, database, and what tasks are appropriate for
                which</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>Web applications are built on a relatively thick stack - from the client (user with their browser) over a
                network to the back-end (server) and database (for data persistence). As a data scientist you won't
                master any particular piece, but you should understand the whole picture.</p>
            <p>A web application is a user-facing piece of software implemented with a client-server architecture. The
                client (the user's browser) makes requests - specifically, <strong>HTTP</strong> (HyperText Transfer
                Protocol) requests over a network (the Internet, or a local network for e.g. internal
                corporate web applications).</p>
            <p>The server receives this request, and then builds and sends a response - generally, a mixture of HTML/CSS
                and JavaScript, a.k.a. “a web page.” The client receives the response, and the web browser renders it so
                the user can see whatever it was they asked for.</p>

            <h3>Follow Along</h3>
            <p>From the above summary, it's fairly clear what the <strong>front-end</strong> of a web application is -
                specifically, it's that HTML/CSS and JavaScript returned in response to user requests. But what's the
                difference between the <strong>back-end</strong> and the database?</p>
            <p>The <strong>back-end</strong> is the direct server receiving requests, and handling the routing/business
                logic to
                determine and send the appropriate response. The <strong>database</strong> is generally a separate
                server where data is
                actually persisted - saved in a durable fashion, for later retrieval by the web application. In fact,
                many web applications are essentially highly usable database querying machines - they let a user
                interact with a front-end, send requests to a back-end which gets or changes data in a database.</p>
            <p>Why separate the back-end and the database? A useful model is to have a back-end server application that
                is stateless (or close to it) - that is, it doesn't persist or save or depend on persisting or saving
                things. It just has the appropriate logic to respond as desired in a given situation - and as such, it's
                much easier to scale, spin up or down extra instances, and so forth.</p>
            <p>Now that you know a bit about the pieces, consider this example of a simple full-stack web application:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Front-end:</strong> a webpage styled with simple CSS (e.g. Bootstrap), listing TODO items
                    for a user in a bullet point list</li>
                <li><strong>Back-end:</strong> a Flask application that receives requests for returning, creating, or
                    completing/deleting TODOs, and returns responses with the appropriate TODOs for the front-end to
                    render</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> a PostgreSQL instance that stores the actual TODO data for users, which
                    the back-end uses to persist and retrieve data</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Think of your own example of a full-stack web application, and list what specific responsibilities you
                think fall to which piece of the stack. You may pick an existing application or one you imagine - in
                either case, share your analysis with a classmate and offer them feedback on theirs.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Now that you know the basics of what a web application is, it's time to build our own! We'll be focusing
                on the back-end, building a simple Python web application with Flask (a microframework) to handle and
                return requests to URL endpoints.</p>
            <pre><code>from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
</code></pre>
            <p>“Hello World!” with Flask is as simple as that - 5 lines of code. Let's understand each one by one.</p>
            <h3>Follow Along</h3>
            <p>Let's break down each of the lines of the above example.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>from flask import Flask</strong> - you've seen plenty of lines like this. We're importing a
                    specific class we want (Flask) from a package (flask). The Flask class will allow us to instantiate
                    our own Flask applications!</li>
                <li><strong>app = Flask(__name__)</strong> - instantiate our own Flask application! It really is just
                    this, __name__ is a bit of Python magic to know the name of the module the execution is occurring in
                    (and it's actually optional, though nice to tell it to Flask). Also note that this is in global
                    scope, so your linter may complain (you can use the all-capitalized variable name <code>APP</code>
                    instead to reflect that it's global), but it is valid code.</li>
                <li><strong>@app.route("/")</strong> - this is a decorator, which is actually a function that takes a
                    function, augments it, and returns it. That may sound scary, but all it's doing is what it says -
                    routing requests to the base <code>/</code> route (the host of the application, without any other
                    path) to be
                    served by this function.</li>
                <li><strong>def hello():</strong> - defining the function to be decorated, which will be invoked by
                    requests to <code>/</code>. The name is actually fairly arbitrary, as far as Flask is concerned -
                    but do try to
                    pick good names for your benefit. This is somewhat like views in other frameworks (e.g. Django),
                    though a good bit lighter and simpler.</li>
                <li><strong>return "Hello World!"</strong> - the response from our function. It means that requests to
                    <code>/</code>
                    will receive a response <code>"Hello World!"</code> - Flask responses can be fancy templates
                    (HTML/CSS and JS),
                    but they can also just be strings, and the latter can be pretty useful for fast developing and
                    prototyping.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Make a new file <code>hello.py</code> with the contents of the above basic “Hello World!” Flask web
                application. Then, get to a terminal and try to run it:</p>
            <pre><code>$ pip install Flask
$ FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run
 * Running on http://localhost:5000/
</code></pre>
            <p>This assumes you have <code>pip</code> ready to go - which you should! You'll only have to install
                <code>Flask</code> once (globally or per environment), and to run an application you specify what it is
                with an environment variable (<code>FLASK_APP=hello.py</code>) and then just <code>flask run</code> -
                and you can do it all in one line!
            </p>
            <p>Once you get it running and see output as above, try to open the URL it gives in your browser. You should
                see “Hello World!” in all its Python Flask glory.</p>
