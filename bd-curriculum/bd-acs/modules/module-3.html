        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Getting Started with LinkedIn</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>LinkedIn is a great way to build your professional network and showcase your experience. Throughout this
                section we will be focusing on the basics of getting your profile set up. These steps are important and
                impact your profile showing up in recruiter searchers! First up, you want to start by making sure your
                personal information is correct and clear.</p>

            <p>To edit your profile, click on the "pencil" icon on the right hand side. From there, you want to fill in
                several things:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>First Name</li>
                <li>Last Name</li>
                <li>Additional Name (This is for a nickname or alternative name that you would like to go by)</li>
                <li>Pronouns (If you'd like to have that information listed)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Headline</h3>
            <p>The key area to update in this space is your headline. Here, you want to customize your headline to list
                job titles you are targeting. If you are in Full stack web, you want to list 'Web Developer' first,
                followed by your focus area of either 'Frontend Software Engineer' or 'Backend Software Engineer.'</p>

            <p>Then, you want to add a few key tools that you have been working with recently. For example, 'JavaScript'
                'React' 'Python' 'Java'</p>

            <p>Customizing this headline section will help your profile be discovered by recruiters using the search
                algorithm, which can generate more connections and possible job opportunities.</p>

            <p>In addition, be sure to scroll down and select an Industry from the drop down. 'Software Development' is
                a common choice.</p>

            <p>Note: Do not add the 'position' or 'education' fields at this point. We will get to that later on.</p>

            <p>Lastly, be sure to fill in your location with your country/region.</p>

            <p>And of course, select 'Save' to save all your changes.</p>

            <h3>Updating the Profile Photo</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the camera icon located in the center of the photo area</li>
                <li>Choose 'upload photo'</li>
                <li>Select a photo where you are clearly viewed</li>
                <li>Change the editing to zoom in or change the filter color</li>
                <li>Select 'Save'</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Banner</h3>
            <p>LinkedIn states that each section that is customized helps boost the strength of the overall profile. For
                the banner, it's recommended to select something that is industry related and professional as this is a
                professional platform.</p>

            <p>You can create a custom banner image using free tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash</a>: Free images
                    and photos you can download and use to create a custom banner.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canva</a>: A free graphic
                    design tool with various templates and tools for creating banners and other graphics.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe
                        Express</a>: Another free graphic design tool that allows you to create banners and other visual
                    content.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While LinkedIn does provide some banner options, it's recommended that you use your own customer banner.
                Once you find a banner image that you like, you are going to select upload, choose that banner, then
                apply to save the banner in place.</p>

            <h3>Profile URL</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Click 'Edit public profile & URL' on the right hand side of the page.</li>
                <li>Click the edit pencil icon under 'personalize the URL' on the right hand side of the page.</li>
                <li>Change the default URL to your name or a handle you use on other public platforms.</li>
                <li>Click 'save'</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Open to Work</h3>
            <p>The open to work feature indicates to recruiters your job preferences and helps your profile to show up
                in designated recruiter searches.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Click on the edit pencil icon in the 'open to work' feature.</li>
                <li>Click 'add titles' under job titles.</li>
                <li>Add variations of the job that you are looking for, adding up to at least five total.</li>
                <li>Select your workplace environment preferences.</li>
                <li>Make sure your start date availability is 'immediately'</li>
                <li>Under job type, make sure you have selected 'all available'</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The final feature in this box is to add the 'Open to Work' visual tag to appear over your photo.This
                indicates that you are actively searching for a job. However, there is an option to show this to
                recruiters only. Play around with this feature - see how engagement goes when the tag is visible versus
                not visible.</p>

            <p>Make sure to save all your changes!</p>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Pull up your LinkedIn Profile and begin to update each of the sections:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Headline</li>
                <li>Profile Photo</li>
                <li>Banner</li>
                <li>Profile URL</li>
                <li>Open to Work</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once updated be sure to save!</p>

            <h2>Adding LinkedIn profile section content</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Now that you've set up the basics of your profile it's time to get into the major content that can really
                help your profile stand out! Start off by clicking the 'Add profile section' button found under your
                profile photo. From there, you'll see a pop up of three options. Go ahead and select 'Core'.</p>

            <h3>Core</h3>
            <p>We're going to fill in this entire section, so start at the top with the 'About me' and add something
                short and sweet. You want to avoid really long paragraphs because no one is going to read two or three
                paragraphs in this area.</p>

            <p>Adding something that is eye-catching here and not too long, with enough valuable information is the key
                to grabbing and keeping the attention of the viewer.</p>

            <p>Things to include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Job Title (ie. Full Stack Engineer)</li>
                <li>What are you passionate about? (ie. creating web applications)</li>
                <li>Overview of background</li>
                <li>Direct the view to what they should look at next (ie. check out my recent posts or recent project
                    highlights posted below)</li>
                <li>Current Tech Stacks and/or tools</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>Under your 'About me' you will see a new section with a button that says 'Add Skills' Here, you will want
                to indicate your top five skills that you want associated with your profile.</p>

            <p>Be sure to hit 'Save' once you are done and review the information added to your profile.</p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Click on 'Add profile section' again and get started under the next area: Add Education</p>

            <p>Fill out the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>School → BloomTech</li>
                <li>Degree → Your program (Full Stack Web, Backend Development, Data Science)</li>
                <li>Start → Year</li>
                <li>Description → Program description (can find on BloomTech Website)</li>
                <li>Skills → Top five skills</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Be sure to do this step for any and all degrees that you hold.</p>

            <p>Note: Once you hit 'save' on this section, LinkedIn will ask if you want to share this news with your
                network. For now, click no or skip because you don't want to alert people of every little update.</p>

            <h3>Career Experience</h3>
            <p>Once again, click into the 'add profile section' under your profile photo, then select 'add position'</p>

            <p>This is where you will add all previous professional positions, starting with the most recent.</p>

            <p>If you have taken a career break, it's best practice to make your recent position 'Freelance Web
                Developer' as this will help with recruiters viewing your profile.</p>

            <p>Fill out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Title</li>
                <li>Employment Type</li>
                <li>Company name (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Start Date</li>
                <li>End Date (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Industry</li>
                <li>Description</li>
                <li>Be sure to include a few key bullet points that details tools you've been using, and things you've
                    been participating in.</li>
                <li>Skills</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Click 'save' and then go back to repeat these steps for each previous role.</p>

            <h3>Skills (again)</h3>
            <p>Yes, you've already added the top five skills in multiple places in this section but now we can add more.
            </p>

            <p>Once again, click into the 'add profile section' under your profile photo, then select 'add skills'</p>

            <p>This is where we maximize the amount of skills associated with your profile. The reason we do this is
                because recruiters use LinkedIn to search for candidates by skills and previous positions or titles. By
                maximizing the amount of skills in your profile, we are maximizing the amount of chances the recruiter
                can find you in a search.</p>

            <p>Note: The max in this section is fifty skills. Be sure to include all fifty.</p>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Pull up your LinkedIn Profile and begin to update each of the sections:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Core</li>
                <li>Skills</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Career Experience</li>
                <li>Skills (again)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once updated be sure to save!</p>

            <p>Linkedin offers a number of other sections that are optional but very impactful if included on your
                profile. The most important and one that we require here at BloomTech is a Projects section. Projects

            <p>In the Career Readiness modules of Units 1, 2, and 3, we established the format of your resume and began
                building out each section. Now, in this core competency, we will finalize your resume, by reviewing each
                section of your resume to ensure you've included all required components. By the end, you will have a
                polished resume ready for submission in the next sprint.</p>

            <h2>Heading</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Your heading is unique to you and contains incredibly important information for a future employer. If
                they don't know how to contact you - they can't move you into an interview process. It is very important
                to confirm your phone number and email are listed correctly within your heading and that all links work.
                Any of this information is incorrect or having broken links can lead to your application being thrown
                out. Here is the information that is typically displayed in your heading:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>First name (use the name you prefer to be called)</li>
                <li>Last name</li>
                <li>The title of the role you are applying for. For this exercise, you will include the future title you
                    would like to have.</li>
                <li>City, State</li>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The projects section of your resume is a crucial component that allows you to showcase your practical
                skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities to potential employers. As a current learner and soon
                to be recent graduate, highlighting relevant projects can significantly enhance your resume and make you
                stand out from the competition. We will provide you with guidance on how to effectively craft a project
                section that captures the attention of recruiters/hiring managers and demonstrates your value as a
                candidate.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Select relevant projects</h3>
            <p>You may be asking yourself what projects you can include at this point on your resume and the great news
                is throughout your time at BloomTech you've already been working on so much that can be included in this
                section.</p>

            <p>Academic Projects: Throughout the entire BloomTech program you will be completing Guided Projects, Sprint
                Challenges, etc. These are all projects that can go on your resume! While these aren't projects you
                created from scratch, they are projects that YOU worked on and will be a great way to showcase your
                skills.</p>

            <p>Personal Projects: You may not be working on any side projects at this point in the program but it's
                never too early to start one. Side projects are invaluable complements to what you are already doing
                here at BloomTech. They provide hands-on experience, reinforce learning, and allow you to explore your
                interests beyond the curriculum's scope. Side projects serve as tangible demonstrations of skills and
                passion, making you more marketable throughout your job search. Side projects not only enhance the
                learning experience during a coding bootcamp but also lay the groundwork for continued growth and
                success as a developer. And great news, you can add to your resume the day you start it! Just list it as
                "In Progress."</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Format your projects</h3>
            <p>Include essential details such as project title, description, your role, technologies used, and outcomes
                achieved. Below is an example of the appropriate format for a project. You will need to include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Title of the project</li>
                <li>Your role on the project</li>
                <li>The tech stack you used</li>
                <li>2- 4 bullet points to highlight key accomplishments and contributions</li>
                <li>Link to the GitHub repo</li>
                <li>Optional: Link to the website if it's deployed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Write your bullet points</h3>
            <p>Project bullet points need to indicate your direct actions and highlight examples of your hands-on dev
                work to validate and showcase your knowledge, skills, and abilities thus far. If this is your first time
                writing technical bullet points, start by first writing down what you did for each project in as much
                detail as possible. Then move on to editing those into stronger bullet points.</p>

            <p>Be sure to keep these tips in mind as you get started:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Start with Action Verbs: Begin each bullet point with an action verb to demonstrate your proactive
                    approach and make your accomplishments stand out. Check out this listLinks to an external site. for
                    ideas.</li>
                <li>Quantify Project Outcomes: Whenever possible, quantify the outcomes of your projects with specific
                    metrics or figures. This provides concrete evidence of your impact and effectiveness. For instance,
                    "Reduced app load time by 40%," "Increased user engagement by 25%," etc.</li>
                <li>Provide Project Context: Offer context for each project by detailing its scope, objectives, and
                    technologies utilized. This helps recruiters understand the complexity and significance of your
                    projects.</li>
                <li>Highlight Project Results: Emphasize the tangible results and accomplishments of your projects
                    rather than simply listing tasks.</li>
                <li>Write in 3rd Person: You should not be using "I" "my" "me" anywhere on your resume or within your
                    bullet points. For example, instead of saying "I coordinated travel for senior leadership," simply
                    say "Coordinated travel for senior leadership."</li>
                <li>Length of Bullet Points: Each bullet point should only be one sentence and should not include any
                    sub bullet points.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Check out this formula/example for a well-written bullet point:</p>

            <p>Formula: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]. In other words, start with an active verb,
                numerically measure what you accomplished, provide a baseline for comparison, and detail what you did to
                achieve your goal.</p>

            <p>Example: Developed a user-friendly application using React, achieving a 30% increase in user engagement
                compared to the previous version, by implementing intuitive UI/UX design principles and incorporating
                user feedback</p>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Pull up the resume you created in Unit 1.</p>

            <p>Follow the 3 steps below to add 2-3 projects to your resume:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Select relevant projects</li>
                <li>Step 2: Format your projects</li>
                <li>Step 3: Write your bullet points</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The experience section of your resume serves as a comprehensive overview of your professional background
                and achievements, providing employers with insight into your skills, capabilities, and suitability for
                the job. As a career transitioner it's extremely important to highlight the transferable skills you
                gained in previous roles prior to BloomTech. Your experience does not have to be related to the tech
                industry in any way. There are transferable skills you can highlight from any work experience from
                Server to Product Manager!</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Select your most relevant/recent experience</h3>
            <p>Whether you have limited experience pre-BloomTech, extensive experience, or are maybe coming off a career
                break we promise you have experience that is relevant to showcase! Start by writing down the different
                roles you've held and making notes under each about what you did. You specifically want to think about
                accomplishments or things you can quantify. Don't just list your job responsibilities instead think
                about what YOU did that was different from everyone else in your same role. For example, let's say you
                spent a few years as a server or retail store associate. Did you ever increase sales via upselling? My
                guess is yes you did! So write that down. These descriptions don't have to sound fancy or be in the
                perfect format, this is about getting everything down on paper so you have it all in front of you.</p>

            <p>Tip: If you have extensive experience from your career pre-BloomTech, create a master resume with all of
                your experience on it (this can be as long as you need it to be). You can then pick and pull from this
                resume the experience that is most relevant to the role you are applying for. For the purposes of your
                career artifacts submission you should include your most recent experience. Ideally you are targeting a
                1 page resume because no matter how much previous experience you have you are still new to the tech
                industry.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Format your experience</h3>
            <p>Below is an example of the appropriate format for your previous experience. You will need to include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Company name</li>
                <li>Location</li>
                <li>Your title</li>
                <li>3 - 4 bullet points to highlight key accomplishments and contributions.</li>
                <li>Dates of employment (month year - month year OR year - year)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Write bullet points</h3>
            <p>In the Experience section, we want to quantify (even if estimated) the value you brought your teammates
                and the companies you were at. This section should clearly highlight your actions, the results of your
                actions, and the overall value Impact you generated for the company. You may notice the format of your
                experience bullet points looks very similar to your project bullet points and that's okay, they should!
                Well-written bullet points with action verbs and quantifiable achievements capture the reader's
                attention and make the resume more engaging and memorable.</p>

            <p>Just as you did with your Project's section be sure to keep these tips in mind as you start to write your
                bullet points:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Start with Action Verbs: Begin each bullet point with an action verb to demonstrate your proactive
                    approach and make your accomplishments stand out. Examples include "developed," "implemented,"
                    "managed," "led," "optimized," etc. Check out this listLinks to an external site. for other ideas
                    and examples.</li>
                <li>Quantify Achievements: Whenever possible, quantify your accomplishments with numbers, percentages,
                    or other measurable metrics. This provides evidence of your contributions and makes your
                    achievements more impactful. For example, "increased sales by 25%," "reduced processing time by
                    50%," etc.</li>
                <li>Provide Context: Give context to your achievements by including relevant details such as project
                    scope, team size, or budget constraints. This helps recruiters understand the scale and complexity
                    of your responsibilities.</li>
                <li>Focus on Results: Highlight the results and outcomes of your actions rather than just listing your
                    job duties. Emphasize how your contributions positively impacted the organization or project.</li>
                <li>Write in 3rd Person: You should not be using "I" "my" "me" anywhere on your resume or within your
                    bullet points. For instance, rather than stating "I managed the company's social media accounts,"
                    you can simply say "Managed the company's social media accounts."</li>
                <li>Length of Bullet Points: Each bullet point should only be one sentence and should not include any
                    sub bullet points.</li>
                <li>Follow this formula when writing your bullets: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]. In
                    other words, start with an active verb, numerically measure what you accomplished, provide a
                    baseline for comparison, and detail what you did to achieve your goal.</li>
                <li>Add details to highlight your direct work actions and tools you used or processes you contributed to
                    that helped improve workflow and data accuracy, and reduced the risk of errors to increase
                    productivity by X%or$</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Check out this formula/examples for a well-written bullet point:</p>

                numerically measure what you accomplished, provide a baseline for comparison, and detail what you did to
                achieve your goal.</p>

                exceeding customer satisfaction targets by 15% through personalized service and attention to detail.</p>

            <p>Example for a Banker: Provided personalized financial guidance and tailored solutions to clients,
                resulting in a 20% increase in client satisfaction scores and a 10% growth in portfolio assets under
                management.</p>

            <p>Example for Construction Manager: Completed projects ahead of schedule by ensuring adherence to safety
                protocols, contributing to a 15% increase in overall project efficiency.</p>

            <p>Example for a Product Manager: Led cross-functional teams in the development and launch of innovative
                products, driving a 25% increase in market share and exceeding revenue targets by 15% through strategic
                planning and effective stakeholder collaboration.</p>

            <p>Example for a Teacher: Facilitated Academic growth resulting in a 20% improvement in standardized test

            <h3>Need help getting started?</h3>
            <p>Use ChatGPT to get an idea of what types of things you could include within your bullet points. Try out
                prompts about your role:</p>

            <p>"Write 5 resume bullet points for a Server at Texas Roadhouse"</p>

            <p>Next, get more specific with some of your accomplishments (use those notes you took about your roles!):
            </p>

            <p>Prompt: "Update the resume bullet points to include the following accomplishments: won award for most
                number of upsells in a shift, consistently received 5 star survey results, selected as employee of the
                month twice."</p>

            <p>Note: Don't just copy and paste the result as these are general bullet points for the roles and may
                include items outside of the scope of what you did. This is to give you a place to start and ideas for
                what you could include.</p>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Pull up the resume you created in Unit 1.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Now that you are nearly finished with the BloomTech program it's important to ensure it's on your resume.
                The certification you are receiving should be included under the Education section on your resume along
                with any other certifications or degrees you may have. Since BloomTech is your most recent experience it
                should be listed first within this section with your anticipated Month and Year of graduation (it's okay
                if this changes). Within each section on your resume, everything should be listed in reverse
                chronological order, meaning your most recent experience/education/project should be listed first.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>You've now completed all the required sections of your resume, congrats!! Throughout the last four units,
                you've learned to craft a compelling and professional resume that effectively showcases your skills,
                projects, and experiences.</p>

            <p>Now it's time to review your resume for any grammatical errors to ensure it's ready for submission when
                you enter the next Sprint. At this point you'll receive detailed feedback from a Career Coach who will
                work with you to ensure your resume is job search ready!</p>

            <h3>Finding Jobs</h3>
            <p>It's that time again! You've completed another 4 sprints and have gained new skills and experience that
                make you qualified for roles within tech. We will continue to explore jobs in every career readiness
                module throughout your time at BloomTech. Remember, these might not be the flashy titles you originally
                had in mind, like Software Developer or Data Scientist but you'll get there!</p>

            <p>We will be exploring tech-adjacent roles that align with the tech skills you've learned but will also be
                using some of the soft or transferable skills you've gained from pre-BloomTech experiences. The best
                part - you can apply for these roles TODAY. It's not just about snagging some income - it's about
                gaining valuable experience that'll make you more marketable as you get closer to graduation. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Example job titles based on your skills so far</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Every time you hit this core competency in the Career Readiness Module the list of job titles you can
                apply for will grow, as your skills grow! We wanted you to see that you're already learning skills
                relevant to the tech industry and have ways to start using those now. That being said, you do not have
                to apply for any roles at this point in the program. However, we still encourage you to go through the
                content and take a stab at finding roles on your own. This will help you feel a bit more confident when
                you do decide to jump into the job search.</p>

            <p>The list below is not exhaustive but does give you an idea of the types of titles you will want to
                explore as you search for roles. Keep in mind these can be full-time or part-time positions.
                Part-time/contract roles can help you continue to build your technical skills while also providing some
                additional income as you finish the program. And you never know, they could lead to a full-time
                opportunity closer to graduation.</p>

            <p>Reminder: Lean into the skills you've learned from a previous profession as well - they can be extremely
                helpful in separating yourself from others in the job market. For example, if you worked in any kind of
                customer service role before coming to BloomTech, highlighting those skills on your resume for a
                Customer Support role or Client Success Specialist will help shape you as a more well-rounded candidate.
                Your background and experience pre-BloomTech will impact the roles you are eligible to apply for.</p>

            <h2>Where to look for roles</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This section is going to look the exact same every time you get to it because we want you to get
                comfortable and familiar with the content! Be sure to try out different job boards each time so you know
                the ones you like when you really dive into the job search. If you aren't applying, that is OK. We just
                want you to see what's out there and understand how to find the opportunities.</p>

            <p>If you are looking, some part-time or contract work may be the best option so that you can do it amidst
                your already busy schedule. You can find these roles across many platforms but you'll find some job
                boards specific to part-time/contract roles listed first.</p>

            <p>Before you get started using any job board continue to keep these tips in mind:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Be sure to set your filters to Date Posted = last 24 hours or last week. If the role has been posted
                    for more than a week the company has most likely started interviewing. Spend your time focusing on
                    roles that are still early in the process.</li>
                <li>Don't reject yourself before you apply! Make sure that you meet at least 50% of the job
                    requirements. This includes years of experience — aim for jobs that call for 0-3 years of relevant
                    experience.</li>
                <li>Use these boards as tools to source roles but apply for the role on the company website. Avoid the
                    easy-apply portal!</li>
                <li>Skip the Links to an external site.cover letter, unless it is explicitly required. They are almost
                    never read. Instead, send a cold (or warm) outreach message to help get your application seen.</li>
                <li>Ensure you complete every box on the application — even if it is just to insert N/A.</li>
                <li>If asked about the desired salary, avoid giving a number. List market rate for {role} in {location}
                    or negotiable. If you must insert a number, list 0. This does not mean you will work for no pay but
                    indicates you are open to discussion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Now it's time again to take the GCA!</h2>
            <p>The General Code Assessment (GCA) is a timed, multiple-choice test that assesses your coding skills and
                knowledge. It is designed to help you determine if you are ready for the Applied Computer Science unit.

            <p>If you haven't already taken it recently, try and attempt it every 2 weeks.</p>
