                <h2>Working with Objects</h2>
                
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Welcome to the world of Objects! JavaScript is called an object-oriented programming language, or OOP for short. This means that JavaScript organizes its software design around objects that can contain data or code. Objects are powerful because they allow us to store multiple related values together in a single container.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What are Objects?</h3>
                    <p>Objects simplify storing values by grouping related values into labeled containers. For example, an inventory app for a grocery store would require variables for item names, prices, and stock quantities. Without objects, finding information for specific items becomes difficult as more variables are added. Objects solve this problem by providing a centralized container to store related values.</p>
                    <p>Objects are an essential building block in Javascript and you will use them every day on the job, so let&apos;s dive right in! In this core competency, you will learn how to declare an object, access properties from an object, and how to add and delete properties within an object.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Declaring an Object</h3>

                    <p>Previously, we became familiar with primitive value types like strings or numbers, which cannot be broken down into simpler values. However, if we think about instances in the real world, like users or restaurant menus, they are pretty complex. That is where objects, or object literals, come into play!</p>
                    <p>An object is an unordered collection of properties and values, called key-value pairs, separated by commas inside curly braces.</p>
                    <p>Let&apos;s investigate the structure of an object:</p>

                    <pre><code>let obj</code></pre>

                    <p>Creating an object starts similarly to a variable using the keyword let or const followed by the object name. We will then assign open and closing curly brackets {} to hold the objects properties. These properties represent the values we want them to hold and their listed as key-value pairs.</p>
                    <p>Let's look at an example of an object with key-value pairs inside:</p>

                    <pre><code>
let person = { first_name: 'Leeroy', last_name: 'Jenkins', age: 25 };
//  the keys or property names (first name, last name, age) are strings
//  property names don't need quotes if they would make valid variable names
//  the values ('Leeroy', 'Jenkins', 25) can be of any type we wish
                    </code></pre>
                    
                    <p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: If we wanted our <code>first_name</code> key to be "first name", we would have to wrap the key in quotes since it would not be a valid variable name, like this: <code>'first name'</code>.</p>

                    <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                    <p>Back at the office, it is time to build out our first Techies user object! After a productive meeting with your team lead and senior developer, you have determined that a user needs to have a name, email address, state, and favorite programming language to start out their profile. They would like you to write a test user object from the below variables to organize users for Techies's quickly growing waitlist. You can write a user object from variables like this:</p>

                    <p>Here are our variables:</p>

                    <pre><code>
const name = 'Amanda Johnson';
const email = 'amandaj@gmail.com';
let state = 'Florida';
let favoriteProgrammingLanguage = 'Javascript';
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>You can organize them into an object like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
const  user = {
name: 'Amanda Johnson',
email: 'amandaj@noemail.com',
state: 'Florida',
'favorite programming language': 'Javascript'
};
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>When creating an object, the biggest thing to remember is that each key-value pair is separated by a comma within the curly brackets. We can now utilize the created user object to keep track of a single user's information in an organized. Your senior developer and team lead are going to love this- great job!</p>

                <h3>Getting properties from an object</h3>
                
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Having lots of information within our objects is great, but in order to be useful, objects must allow us to access the values inside them. As a software developer, you will be accessing information from objects almost daily so this is an important skill employers look for when hiring for their team. The way we read a value from an object is by its key, also known as a property.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are two ways to access properties within an object: using <strong>dot notation</strong> and <strong>square bracket notation</strong>.</p>

                    <p>In <strong>dot notation</strong>, we write the name of the object followed by a dot (.) followed by the property we would like to access.</p>
                    
                    <pre><code>
// getting properties using dot notation
const dog = {name: 'Ruby', breed: 'Boxer', weight: 65, 'favorite toy': 'bone'}
dog.name; // evaluates to 'Ruby'
dog.breed; // evaluates to 'Boxer'
dog.weight; // evaluates to 65
let breed = dog.breed;
console.log(`It's a ${breed}!`); // prints "It's a Boxer!"
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>In <strong>square bracket notation</strong>, we write the name of the object followed by an open square bracket [ followed by the property we would like to access in quotes followed by a closing square bracket ].</p>

                    <pre><code>
// getting properties using square-bracket notation
let player2 = { username: 'elf123', role: 'ranger', 'health points': 15 };
let healthPoints = player2['health points']; // quotes needed
console.log(`Only ${healthPoints} points left!`); // prints "Only 15 points left!"
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>In square bracket notation, we have used strings for property names, but you could also use variables. While this is less common, it is something you may see out in the wild.</p>

                    <pre><code>
// getting properties using square-bracket notation and a variable
let plane = { model: 'Supermarine Spitfire' };
let propName = 'model';
console.log(plane[propName]); // quotes not needed as it's a variable, prints "Supermarine Spitfire"
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Finally, if you are trying to access a property from an object that does not exist, you will receive <code>undefined</code>. This is great to know for when you need to debug code that isn't working.</p>

                    <pre><code>
// getting a property that doesn't exist
let empty = {};
console.log(empty.prop); // prints undefined
                    </code></pre>

                    <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                    <p>After a successful first task, your team lead and senior developer decide that they would like to have you start building out the user profile from the information in the user objects. They would like you to write a test user profile page that accesses the properties from the following user object:</p>

                    <pre><code>
const  user = {
name: 'Josh Carter',
email: 'carterjosh@gmail.com',
state: 'Utah',
'favorite programming language': 'Javascript'
};
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>With the user object in hand, we can access the properties we want to show on our user profile page like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
let nameToDisplay = user.name;
console.log(`Welcome Back, ${nameToDisplay}!`); // prints "Welcome Back, Josh Carter!"
user.state; // evaluates to 'Utah'
user.email; // evaluates to 'carterjosh@noemail.com'
user['favorite programming language']; // evaluates to 'Javascript'
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>We now have the values that we want to show on the profile page for users when they login to the Techies platform. This will give our users a personalized experience that will keep users engaged. Your senior developer and team lead are definitely able to use this in the program- fantastic job!</p>

            <div class="content-box module2-accent">
                <h3>Setting and deleting properties</h3>

                <p>We have learned so far that objects are very flexible, but what if we need to change the value of a property, or even remove a property altogether? The good news is that we can add, edit, or remove properties from objects at any time.</p>
                <p>Like how we accessed properties, there are two ways to set and delete properties within an object: <strong>dot notation</strong> and <strong>square bracket notation</strong>.</p>

                <p>To set a value using dot notation, we use the same “object.property” structure we’re used to and add an equal sign =, and then the new value of that property (just like how you set values to variables).</p>

                <pre><code>
//  setting properties using dot notation
let country = {};
country.name = 'United States'; // _adding_ a new 'name' prop
console.log(country); // prints { name: "United States" }

country.population = 340,092,699; // _adding_ a new 'population' prop
console.log(country); // prints { name: "United States", population: 340,092,699 }

country.population = 81; // editing an existing 'population' prop
console.log(country); // prints { name: "United States", population: 81 }
                </code></pre>

                <p>To set a value using square bracket notation, we use the same “object[property]” structure we're used to and add an equal sign = and the value of that property.</p>

                <pre><code>
//  setting properties using square-bracket notation
country['favorite food'] = 'cheeseburger'; // _adding_ a new 'favorite food' prop
console.log(country); // prints { name: "United States", population: 81, "favorite food": "cheeseburger" }
                </code></pre>

                <p>To delete properties within an object, we use the delete operator followed by either “object.property” or “object[property]”, depending on the property you would like to delete.</p>

                <pre><code>
//  deleting properties with the delete operator
delete country.population;
delete country['favorite food'];
console.log(country); // prints { name: "United States" }
                </code></pre>

                <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                <p>Your team lead and senior developer decide that users want to know more about their colleagues' work when connecting with them on Techies. They would like you to add a GitHub username property, edit the state property to the state abbreviation, and remove the favorite programming language property from the below user object. You can make changes to an object's properties like this:</p>

                <p>Here is our user object:</p>

                <pre><code>
const  user = {
name: 'Fabiola Dallas',
email: 'fabdallas@noemail.com',
state: 'Texas',
'favorite programming language': 'Python'
};
                </code></pre>

                <p>We can add a GitHub username property we want to show in our user profile like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
user['Github Username] = 'Fabiola123';
                </code></pre>

                <p>We can edit the state property like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
user.state = 'TX';
                </code></pre>

                <p>We can then delete the favorite programming language property like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
delete user['favorite programming language'];
                </code></pre>

                <p>We now have more relevant information for users when they connect with others on the Techies platform. This will promote collaboration between users on the platform. Your senior developer and team lead are so proud of the great work you have accomplished at Techies. Awesome job completing this case study!</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>In this core competency, we learned about one of Javascript's most flexible data types: Objects! We've covered the essential pieces of the object syntax, how to declare an object, how to access properties within an object, and how to add, edit, and remove properties within an object. We have only scratched the surface of how useful objects can be in our programs, but don't worry! You will learn more about objects later in the program. We highly recommend that you practice with objects because you will use them every day in your software development career.</p>

            <div class="content-box module2-accent">
                <h2>Arrays</h2>
                <p>Welcome to arrays in JavaScript! Arrays are used to store and organize collections of data and are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer programming. You will use arrays almost every single day while you are on the job. You will find that arrays are incredibly versatile and offer endless data manipulation and organization possibilities. By mastering the use of arrays in JavaScript, you'll be equipped with a powerful tool that will enable you to write efficient and effective code.</p>
                <p>Arrays can be used in countless real-life scenarios, from organizing a shopping list to tracking different destinations you'd like to travel to. Imagine you're a librarian and you need to keep track of all the books of each genre in your library. You could create an array to hold the titles of all the books, and then use different methods to change and access the data as needed.</p>
                <p>In this core competency, you will learn how to declare an array, access and set elements in an array, work with array lengths, and how to split strings into an array. So let's dive in and explore the world of arrays!</p>

                <h3>Declaring an array literal</h3>

                <p>An array, or array literal, is an ordered collection of values separated by commas inside square braces. You can make an array using square brackets and adding values within those brackets, separated by commas. Then, just like any other value or object, you can set that array to a variable. Let's investigate the structure of an array:</p>

                <pre><code>
// declaring an (empty) array literal:
const array = [];
                </code></pre>

                <p>Values within an array can be of any type, including other arrays. Let's look at a couple of examples of arrays with different types of values inside:</p>

                <pre><code>
//array holding a boolean, a number, and an object
const values = [true, 15.4, { name: 'Bloomtech' } ];
                </code></pre>

                <pre><code>
//an array holding 2 arrays
const grid = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];
                </code></pre>

                <p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: You previously learned that Javascript is considered an object-oriented programming language and became familiar with a special data type called objects. You will notice that arrays and so much of JavaScript draw from the information we learn about objects. If you use the <code>typeof</code> operator on arrays, which tells us what data type a piece of our code is, it will return an object!</p>

                <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                <p>Back at the office, it is time to build out our first array of tour dates for Energy Entertainment! They have various dates for their musicians and they need to display the dates in order on their tour webpages. After a productive meeting with your senior developer, you have determined that you can store these dates in an array so the dates will display in a certain order. They would like you to write a tour dates array from the below list to organize one of the musician's schedule for their much-anticipated European tour. You can write an array from values like this:</p>
                <p>Here are the concert dates for the tour:</p>
                <p>April 26, April 29, May 5, May 10, May 17</p>
                <p><strong>You can organize them into an array like this:</strong></p>
                <pre><code>
const  concerts = ['April 26', 'April 29', 'May 5', 'May 10', 'May 17'];
                </code></pre>
                <p>You can now utilize the created concerts array to keep track of a single artist's schedule in an organized way. Your senior developer is going to love this- great job!</p>

            <div class="content-box module2-accent">

                <h3>Accessing elements in an array</h3>

                <p>Accessing the values, also called elements, inside an array is done using the element's index, or numbered location within the array. As a software developer, you will be accessing information from arrays many, many times so this is an essential skill employers will expect you to have proficiency in.</p>

                <p>The way you read an element from an array by its index is with square bracket notation. Indices start at zero and increase depending on the number of elements in the array. In square bracket notation, you write the name of the array followed by an opening square bracket [ followed by the index you would like to access, and then a closing square bracket ].</p>

                <p>Let's take a closer look at this syntax using a friends example:</p>

                <pre><code>
// getting elements using square bracket notation
const friends = ['Josh', 'Alla', 'Byron']; // array literal containing three strings

const firstFriend = friends[0]; // firstFriend evaluates to 'Josh'

const secondFriend = friends[1]; // secondFriend evaluates to 'Alla'

const thirdFriend = friends[2]; // thirdFriend evaluates to 'Byron'
                </code></pre>

                <p>If you are trying to access an index from an array that is too large, you will receive undefined. This is great to know for when you need to debug code that isn't working.</p>

                <pre><code>
// getting an element that doesn't exist
const friends = ['Josh', 'Alla', 'Byron'];
const notThere = friends[3]; // notThere evaluates to undefined
                </code></pre>

                <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                <p>Let's head back to the office! After a successful first task, your team lead has gotten the tour webpage design back and decided that they would like to have you start building out the webpage from the information in the concerts array. They would like you to write a test tour webpage that accesses the elements from the following array and verify that they are in the correct order:</p>

                <pre><code>
const  concerts = ['April 26', 'April 29', 'May 5', 'May 10', 'May 17'];
                </code></pre>

                <p>With the concerts array in hand, you can access the elements you want to show on the tour webpage like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
console.log(“European Tour Dates!”); // prints "European World Tour Dates!"
concerts[0]; // evaluates to 'April 26'
concerts[1]; // evaluates to 'April 29'
concerts[2]; // evaluates to 'May 5'
concerts[3]; // evaluates to 'May 10'
concerts[4]; // evaluates to 'May 17'
                </code></pre>

                <p>You now have the elements that you want to show on the tour webpage and verify that they are in the correct order for users when they are ready to purchase tickets for the concerts. This will give the users the information they need to pick the best tour date for them. Your team lead is definitely able to use this in the program- fantastic job!</p>

                <h3>Setting elements in an array</h3>

                <p>You are getting more comfortable with the structure of arrays and how to access elements within arrays, but what if you need to add an element to an array or even change an element altogether? Don't worry! You have the ability to add and overwrite elements within an array, similarly to how you did with objects.</p>
                <p>Like how you accessed elements, the way to set or overwrite an element is with square bracket notation. To set an element using square bracket notation, you use the same <code>array[index]</code> structure you're used to and assign the value of that element.</p>

                <pre><code>
// setting elements using square-bracket notation
const friends = []; // an empty array literal

friends[0] = 'Josh'; // setting the first element of the array

friends[1] = 'Alla'; // setting the second element of the array

friends[2] = 'Byron'; // setting the third element of the array

console.log(friends); // prints ['Josh', 'Alla', 'Byron']

// overwriting elements using square-bracket notation

friends[2] = 'Jess'; // changes the third element to 'Jess'

console.log(friends); // prints ['Josh', 'Alla', 'Jess']
                </code></pre>

                <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                <p>Just before ticket sales for the musician's European Tour start, your team lead found out that the executives at Energy Entertainment have decided to postpone the European tour to May. Because of this, the April 26th and 29th concerts have been rescheduled to May 26th and 29th, and the Executives have added a tour date for May 1st. They would like you to set the April tour date elements to the new date and add the new tour date. You can make changes to an array's elements like this:</p>

                <p>Here is the concerts array:</p>

                <pre><code>
const  concerts = ['April 26', 'April 29', 'May 5', 'May 10', 'May 17'];
                </code></pre>

                <p>You set an element you want to change in the concerts array like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
concerts[0] = 'May 26';
concerts[1] = 'May 29';
                </code></pre>

                <p>You set a new element in the concerts array like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
Concerts[5] = 'May 1';   
                </code></pre>

                <p>We now have the correct dates, but now the dates are out of order. You can reorder the dates to the correct index like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
concerts[0] = 'May 1';
concerts[1] = 'May 5';
concerts[2] = 'May 10';
concerts[3] = 'May 17';
concerts[4] = 'May 26';
concerts[5] = 'May 29';
                </code></pre>

                <p>Now the team can go live with ticket sales for the European Tour! Great work making those last-minute changes. Being able to quickly change dates is crucial for music managers because you never know when something will come up. Your team lead is very proud of your progress on the production team - Keep it up!</p>

                <h3>Working with array lengths</h3>

                <p>Arrays have a property called length that will return the length, or the number of items, in an array. To use the length property on an array, you use the same “object.property” structure you've used before. There are multiple ways to use the length property, so let's dive into some examples!</p>

                <p>The first way you can use <code>.length</code> is by setting your <code>array.length</code> equal to a variable like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
// finding the length of an array
const friends = ['Josh', 'Alla', 'Anne'];

const numberOfFriends = friends.length; //evaluates to 3

console.log(`I have ${numberOfFriends} friends!`); // prints I have 3 friends!
                </code></pre>

                <p>For our next examples, imagine hundreds of elements inside the array instead of three. Another way you can use <code>.length</code> is in an expression to find an index (an expression is a fancy way of saying pieces of code that evaluate as a single value). Putting an expression inside square brackets is okay as long as it evaluates to a number greater than or equal to zero. You can use this to grow an array!</p>

                <pre><code>
// using .length to make an array grow
const friends = []; // we start sadly with no friends.

friends[friends.length] = 'Josh' // since friends.length is 0 this is the same as saying friends[0] = 'Josh'

friends[friends.length] = 'Alla' // rinse and repeat except that here, friends.length is 1

friends[friends.length] = 'Byron' // rinse and repeat except that here, friends.length is 2

console.log(friends); // prints ['Josh', 'Alla', 'Byron'] because we have pushed three elements into the array.
                </code></pre>

                <p>Scrolling infinitely through an array is not fun; luckily, there is a way to find the last element in an array. You can access the last element in an array by using the name of the array, followed by <code>.length - 1.</code></p>
                <p>Let's see this in action:</p>

                <pre><code>
// accessing the last element in an array
const friends = ['Josh', 'Alla', 'Anne'];

const lastButNotLeast = friends[friends.length - 1]; // evaluates to 'Anne'
                </code></pre>

                <p>You can also access the last element in an array using the <code>at</code> method. We write this by starting with the name of the array, followed by <code>.at(-1).</code></p>

                <pre><code>
// accessing the last element in an array using at
const friends = ['Josh', 'Alla', 'Anne'];

const lastButNotLeast = friends.at(-1); // lastButNotLeast evaluates to 'Anne'

const nextToLast = friends.at(-2); // nextToLast evaluates to 'Alla'
                </code></pre>

                <p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Previously, you covered that arrays were actually special objects with additional functionality. Because of this, you are able to combine what you learned from objects and use properties on arrays.</p>

                <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                <p>Back at Energy Entertainment, your Team Lead calls you in for a meeting. You have been doing so well that they would like your help building out a popular boy band's World Tour marketing webpage! The World Tour consists of over 50 concert dates so it would be impossible to scroll through the entire array of data. Your senior developer has already created the “dates” array for you, but your job is to now display how many tour dates there are in total and display the last tour date. You can display the total number of tour dates like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
console.log(`2BU will be live in ${dates.length} concerts for their comeback World Tour!`);
// prints '2BU will be live in 55 concerts for their comeback World Tour!'
                </code></pre>

                <p>You can display the last tour date like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
console.log(`Your last chance to see 2BU is ${dates[dates.length - 1]}!`);
// prints 'Your last chance to see 2BU is December 22!'
                </code></pre>

                <p>You can also display the last tour date like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
console.log(`Your last chance to see 2BU is ${dates.at(-1)}!`);
// also prints 'Your last chance to see 2BU is December 22!'
                </code></pre>

                <p>The marketing team is very grateful that you were able to add these key phrases to improve ticket sales for 2BU's World Tour. This is helpful because if dates have to change for any reason, marketing will not have to rewrite the phrases because you've added these dynamic array properties. Stellar job completing this!</p>

                <h3>Splitting a string into an array</h3>

                <p>Arrays are so useful for occasions where you are asked to count words in a piece of writing or even for security reasons to keep a user's password safe. Instead of having to take the time to break apart string yourself, did you know that you can create arrays from strings? You have functions called methods that can help us perform many different tasks. Methods should look familiar because you have been using a log method when typing console.log().</p>
                <p>Strings have a method called split that we can use to create arrays. To split a string with the split method, you call the function on the string, like <code>string.split()</code> and in the parentheses, you will include what's called a separator, or the value where you would like to split the string. Let's look at the split method in action with some examples.</p>
                <p>When you want to separate a string with no white space, you will use an empty string '' as your separator.</p>

                <pre><code>
// Splitting words into characters
const name = 'Paris';
const characters = name.split(''); // splitting by empty string
console.log(characters); // prints ['P', 'a', 'r', 'i', 's']
                </code></pre>

                <p>When you want to separate a string with one or more white spaces, you will use a string with a single space ' ' as your separator.</p>

                <pre><code>
// 👉 Splitting sentences into words
const sentence = 'Paris is on my bucket list to visit!';
const words = sentence.split(' '); // splitting by whitespace
console.log(words); // prints ['Paris', 'is', 'on', 'my', 'bucket', 'list', 'to', 'visit!']
                </code></pre>

                <p>Remember that having a space in a string still counts as a string!</p>

                <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                <p>Time for your last shift at Energy Entertainment! Your Team Lead just finished a meeting with a manager of a new pop star client named Chic. The manager gave your team a string containing the tour dates for Chic's North American debut Tour. The tour website only knows how to display tour dates from an array so it's easier to make changes. Your job is to create an array from this string so that you can easily display this on the tour webpage. The string looks like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
let chicTour = "June 1, 2023 - Los Angeles, CA | June 3, 2023 - San Francisco, CA | June 5, 2023 - Seattle, WA | June 7, 2023 - Vancouver, BC"

You can create an array from this string using the split method like this:

chicDates = chicTour.split(" | "); // evaluates to [“June 1 - Los Angeles”, “June 3 - San Francisco”, “June 5 - Seattle”, “June 7 - Vancouver”]
                </code></pre>

                <p>You can now use this array to display the tour dates in the desired order for your production team. Your senior developer and team lead are so proud of the great work you have accomplished at Energy Entertainment.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>Congratulations on completing this core competency on arrays in JavaScript! By now, you should understand how to declare an array, access and modify elements within an array, and work with array lengths. You've also covered how to split a string into an array, a valuable technique for manipulating data in a more structured way. But this is just the beginning! Arrays have much to offer you as a developer, but now you are comfortable with the basics before diving deeper. You will learn much more about arrays later on in the program. We highly recommend you keep practicing, experimenting, and exploring arrays because they will frequently be used in your software development career.</p>

                <h2>Basic Looping</h2>

                <p>Loops are one of the most commonly used tools in JavaScript. They are so common, in fact, that you will probably use them in every coding project both at BloomTech and in your careers. In short, loops allow you to repeat a block of code (or function) numerous times without writing the same code repeatedly. This is usually done to create new things like objects and arrays or to iterate over existing ones you want to pull information from or edit in some way.</p>
                <p>Let's assume you were given a long list of items in an array, say a list of food items available for purchase at your local grocery store. It would be quite a tedious task if you wanted to show fifty items on a webpage and had to write a new function to display each item listed in an array. This is where loops come in handy. They allow you to perform the same function for multiple items in an array (or object) with a simple block of code.</p>
                <p>In this reading, you will learn how to use one of the most common types of loops: the “for…in” loop, and how we can use that loop to carry out the same function for all items in arrays and objects.</p>

                <h3>Looping over array indices</h3>

                <p>Perhaps the most common way to loop through all items, or indices, of an array is by using the “for…in” loop. The standard format of a “for…in” loop looks like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
const arrayName = ["item1", "item2", "item3"] // creating a sample array

for (let i in arrayName) { // loops through all indices in that array
     console.log(i, arrayName[i]) // prints out index position and item number
}

/* prints
0 item1
1 item2
2 item3
*/
                </code></pre>

                <p>There are a few key features within the parenthesis of this “for…in” loop worth explaining that are common in other types of loops:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>let i</code> portion is declaring a variable name for the index number or position of each item in the array that you can reference later in the function. Though <code>i</code> or <code>index</code> is typically usually used as a name, any name would technically work.</li>
                    <li>With the <code>in arrayName</code> portion, you are specifying the name of which array you want to iterate, or loop, through.</li>
                    <li>Finally, you have the function between the curly brackets that will perform on each item in that array. You can use the index variable, <code>i</code>, that you declared earlier to specify what you want to do with each item. Printing just <code>i</code> will print the index position, whereas printing <code>arrayName[i]</code> will print the actual value of that item with that index.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                <p>Let's return to our scenario where you need to specify that you want to display (or in our case, just print out) all the items of a particular store, “Coco Mart,” on the store's homepage of your Food To Me application. You receive an array from your database called <code>cocoMart</code> that contains a list of all the active items that that particular store is selling. You want to print “_____ is now available!” for each item.</p>

                <p>Here is how that would work:</p>

                <pre><code>
const cocoMart = ["Bananas", "Milk", "Eggs", "Bread", "Yogurt"] // created “Coco Mart” array

for (let i in cocoMart) { //declares “i” as variable index name, loops through items in cocoMart array
     console.log(`${cocoMart[i]} is now available!`)
}

/* prints out
Bananas is now available!
Milk is now available!
Eggs is now available!
Bread is now available!
Yogurt is now available!
*/
                </code></pre>

                <p>Same as above, you are using the variable you defined for the index <code>i</code> to cycle through all the items of the <code>cocoMart</code> array and print the values found at those indices.</p>

                <h3>Looping over object properties</h3>

                <p>Similar to arrays, “for..in” loops can also be used to iterate over object properties within an object. However, since the order of properties of objects is arbitrary (meaning, there are no index positions for properties of an object), the variable <code>i</code> which was used to represent indices for arrays, is now replaced with a word like <code>property</code> for objects. And, instead of an index, the <code>property</code> variable will now refer to the property name, or key. Let's see this in the following example:</p>

                <pre><code>
const sampleObject = { propertyA: "value1", propertyB: "value2", propertyC: "value3" } //sample created object

for (let property in sampleObject) { // iterates over all properties in the sampleObject
  console.log(property) //prints “propertyA, propertyB, propertyC”
  console.log(sampleObject[property]) //prints “value1, value2, value3”
}
                </code></pre>

                <p>Notice in the second <code>console.log()</code> we used the <code>sampleObject[property]</code> which refers to the actual value of each property, not the property name itself.</p>

                <h3>How to Build It</h3>

                <p>Let's see how this plays out in the application we are building for “Food To Me”. Let's say, instead of an array, we now have an object for each food item (which is much more realistic). Each food item will now have three properties: a name, a price, and availability; and will look like this:</p>

                <pre><code>
const foodItem = {
    name: "bananas",
    price: 2.99,
    availability: false
}
                </code></pre>

                <p>Let's now look at a solution that will iterate through each of these three properties, but only return the value of the name and price properties in a sentence that reads: “This product costs $price.”  Warning, this will require an extra step to include an <code>if</code> statement.  </p>

                <pre><code>
for (let property in foodItem) { // iterates through each property of the “foodItem” object
    if (property === 'price') { // checks if property is price
        console.log(`This product costs $${foodItem[property]}`) // prints "This product costs $2.99"
    }
    }
                </code></pre>

                <p>Take note of the two dollar signs (<code>$$</code>) together. Remember that the second <code>$</code> is part of the syntax for a string template literal, which allows us to insert the variable <code>foodItem[property]</code>. The first <code>$</code> is an actual dollar sign that we want to display with the price.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>In this core competency, we introduced the concept of loops and learned how to use one of the most commonly used types of loops, the “for…in” loop. We learned that when using a “for…in” loop with an array, the <code>i</code> refers to the index position, whereas in objects the <code>i</code> refers to the property name. We will cover a few more types of loops shortly, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, but the good news is that loops essentially do the same type of logic, performing the same function on every item within a list. We hope that you don't get too discouraged when working with loops. Like everything in coding, with practice, they will become very familiar. But unlike everything, loops can be necessary to keep your code succinct when working with lists.</p>
