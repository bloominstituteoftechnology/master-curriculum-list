            <h2>Module Overview</h2>
            <p>In Module 1, we focused on hypothesis testing with t-tests, which are used for continuous data. In this
                module, we'll explore hypothesis testing with chi-square tests, which are used for categorical data.</p>
            <p>Chi-square tests allow us to determine whether there is a significant association between categorical
                variables or whether observed categorical data matches what we would expect under a certain hypothesis.
                These tests are essential when analyzing survey responses, demographic information, or any data where
                variables are measured in categories rather than continuous values.</p>

            <h2>Objective 01 - Explain the Purpose of a Chi-square Test and Identify Applications</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In this section, we're going to discuss a new statistical test called the chi-square test. It's sometimes
                written using the Greek letter chi, which looks like a wavy capital X:
                .</p>
            <p>So why do we need yet another statistical test? Well, we can't apply a t-test to all situations. In some
                cases, we need to compare populations in different ways to determine how they are or are not related.
            </p>
            <p>For example, we might have two or more populations for which we would like to compare two or more
                response categories. Say we are looking at the proportion of men and women who say their Facebook
                viewing time increases during specific months of the year. We would then not be calculating the mean of
                this sample distribution but rather if the amount of viewing time of one is significant compared to
                another group. </p>
            <p>Another application of the chi-square test is to determine if two categorical variables are independent.
                An example might be to look at the association between texting while driving and car accidents. How can
                we determine if these two variables are related to each other?</p>
            <p>The chi-square test of independence is another way to state this type of test: how dependent or
                independent are the two variables being tested. Let's move right into an example!</p>
            <h3>Follow Along</h3>
            <h4>Chi-square Statistic</h4>
            <p>To complete a chi-square test on our sample populations, we need to set up our variables in a
                "contingency table." It's called this because we're testing to see if the number of cases in one of our
                categories is contingent upon (dependent on/independent of) the other variable.</p>
            <h4>Contingency Table</h4>
            <p>For this example, we'll look at some made-up data about cats and dogs and if they prefer treats or toys.
                Then, based on our chi-square analysis, we'll be able to make a statement about the preferences of the
                animals based on statistics.</p>

            </table>
            <p>Based on these numbers, we can calculate the expected values by dividing the values in the columns by the
                total for that column.</p>
            <h4>Expected Value</h4>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Cats</th>

                        <td>Treats</td>
                        <td>(600x490)/1800 = 163.33</td>
                        <td>(1200x490)/1800 = 326.67</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Toys</td>
                        <td>(600x1310)/1800 = 436.67</td>
                        <td>(1200x1310)/1800 = 873.33</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>We have this fancy table and expected values for cats and dogs preferences for either treats or toys. But
                how do we know if any of these results are statistically significant? Calculating the chi-square
                statistic comes in at this point. The following formula calculates the chi-square statistic:</p>
            <p><strong>chi-square = sum(observed-expected)^2/expected)</strong></p>
            <p>Taking this formula, we'll calculate the chi-square statistic for our pet data.</p>
            <h4>Chi-square statistic: calculation</h4>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Cats</th>
                        <th>Dogs</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Treats</td>
                        <td>(200-163.33)^2 / 163.33 = 8.23</td>
                        <td>(290-326.67)^2 / 326.67 = 4.12</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Toys</td>
                        <td>(400-436.67)^2 / 436.67 = 3.08</td>
                        <td>(910-873.33)^2 / 873.33 = 1.54</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>And after summing up the value in each cell, we'll have the chi-square statistic: 8.23 + 3.08 + 4.12 +
                1.54 = 16.97. 16.97 is our observed chi-square value. The final step is to compare the observed value we
                calculated to the critical chi-square value. The critical chi-square value depends on the degrees of
                freedom in your data set and determines if your results are statistically significant.</p>
            <p>In our above data set, for one degree of freedom and an alpha level of 0.05, we can use <a
                    href="https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/tbl-chi.html" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">this table</a> to
                look up the critical chi-square value as 3.84. Our calculated chi-square of
                16.79 is greater than 3.84, so we can conclude our results are not due to chance. We can say that cats
                enjoy treats significantly more than dogs. (Remember this is manufactured data; your dog or cat may not
                fit into the above category)</p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Now it's your turn to practice calculating a chi-square statistic. Using the above examples, create your
                contingency table using some data that interests you. You can search for a "contingency table" and see
                if some small example tables have data in a suitable format. Use the following steps to calculate your
                chi-square value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Put your data in a table format similar to the one shown above.</li>
                <li>Calculate the expected value for each cell in the table.</li>
                <li>Then calculate the chi-square value for each cell.</li>
                <li>Finally, add up all the chi-square values for the chi-square statistic.</li>
                <li>Use the <a href="https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/tbl-chi.html" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">table here</a> to determine your critical chi-square.</li>
                <li>And finally, determine if your result is statistically significant.</li>

            <h2>Objective 02 - Set Up a Chi-square Test for Independence on Two Categorical Variables</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In the previous objective, we learned about the chi-square statistic. We worked out the chi-square value
                by hand using a contingency table. For this next objective, we're going to use the magic of SciPy and
                the <code>scipy.stats</code> module to compute the chi-square statistic.</p>

            <h3>Follow Along</h3>
            <p>We'll look at our previous contingency table example so that we can compare our <code>scipy.stats</code>
                results to our manual calculation.</p>

            <h4>Cats, Dogs, and Treats</h4>
            <p>Remember our contingency table from earlier in the module?</p>

            <h5>Contingency Table: Cats &amp; Dogs</h5>

            </table>

            <p>Using these values, we calculated a chi-square statistic of 16.97. Next, we'll put these same values into
                the SciPy stats chi2_contingency function, which will perform a chi-square test of the independence of
                the variables in the given contingency table.</p>

            <pre><code># Import the libraries
import numpy as np

# Create the table using as a NumPy array
table = np.array([[200, 290], [400, 910]])

# Print out the table to double-check
print('Contingency table: \n', table)

# Perform the chi-square test
stat, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(table, correction=False)

# Print out the stats in a nice format
print('Expected values: \n ', expected.round(2))
print(f'The chi square statistics is: {stat:.3f}')
print(f'The p value is: {p:.6f}')

            <h2>Objective 03 - Use a Chi-square Test p-value to Draw the Correct Conclusion About the Null and
                Alternative Hypothesis</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>We've already covered a p-value and how we apply it to a null and alternative hypothesis. But let's go
                over a quick review.</p>
            <p>When we perform a hypothesis test, we calculate a p-value. Using the significance level we decided on
                before performing our test, we then have enough information to either 1) reject or 2) fail to reject the
                null hypothesis.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>p-value &lt; alpha: reject the null hypothesis</li>
                <li>p-value &gt; alpha: fail to reject the null hypothesis</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Example: Dice Roll</h3>
            <p>We can use a chi-square test on a collection of dice rolls to determine if the dice are fair or if the
                random number generator we are using is random (well, as far as we can detect).</p>
            <p>Using dice roll statistics as our data set, we're going to work through the whole process of stating the
                null hypothesis, performing a chi-square test, deciding on the significance level, determining the
                p-value, and then making a decision on the null hypothesis.</p>
            <h3>Follow Along</h3>
            <p>We already know the expected value of each number when we roll a dice. For example, for a six-sided die,
                each number should occur 1/6 or about 16.67% of the time. But, we can estimate the expected frequency
                for each value by using a random number generator.</p>
            <p>Let's decide on the null hypothesis and the significance level.</p>
            <h4>Null Hypothesis</h4>
            <p>For this situation, it would make sense to choose the null hypothesis to simply be: "the dice are fair".
            </p>
            <h4>Generated Dice Rolls</h4>
            <p>We used the random number generator in Python to simulate the dice rolling results. We "rolled" five
                dice, each a total of 50 times. Here are the results, along with the total for each value between 1-6

            <p>Each value should come up 1/6 of the time; the total number of rolls is 250, and 250/6=41.67. So we can
                see that the results are pretty close to that number for most of the values except for one (a little
                high) and six (a little low).</p>
            <p>Let's put the data in NumPy arrays and run a chi-square test on them.</p>
            <pre><code>import numpy as np

            <pre>
Expected values: 
  [[9.6 9.6 9.6 9.6 9.6]
 [7.4 7.4 7.4 7.4 7.4]
 [7.6 7.6 7.6 7.6 7.6]

 [9.  9.  9.  9.  9. ]

The degrees of freedom:  20
The chi square statistics is: 40.375
The p value is: 0.004477</pre>
            <h4>Interpret the result - computer generated</h4>
            <p>Now we need to use the <a href="https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/tbl-chi.html"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Table: Chi-Square Probabilities</a> and a significance
                level to interpret our
                result.</p>
            <p>Let's choose an alpha level of 0.05. Our calculated chi-square of 40.375 is greater than 31.410. Our
                calculated p-value is 0.00447, which is less than 0.05. We reject our null hypothesis that the die is
                fair, and can conclude that the computer is using a "rigged" die.</p>
            <h4>Physical Dice</h4>
            <p>Let's look at the rolls from a random assortment of actual, physical dice. We set up the number of rolls
                and dice the same way as for the random number generator. Here are the results of rolling five dice 50
                times each.</p>

            <h4>Interpret the result - human generated</h4>
            <p>Again, we'll use the table <a href="https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/tbl-chi.html"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Table: Chi-Square Probabilities</a> and a significance
                level to interpret our
                result.</p>
            <p>For this trial, we'll use an alpha level of 0.05. Our calculated chi-square of 21.989 is less than
                31.410. As with the example above, we can also use the calculated p-value. In this case, our p-value of
                0.34 is greater than our alpha of 0.05, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
            <p>We can conclude that our results are what we would expect if the physical dice used were fair.</p>
            <p>Both sets of tests could return different results based on the values used.</p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>You may take the opportunity to generate your own dice-rolling data and see how your results compare to
                the computer-generated ones. You can use fewer dice (and roll more than one at a time) to collect your
                sample. Once you have some data, construct a contingency table and calculate your chi-square statistic.
                Then compare your results using your preferred significance level. Are your dice fair?</p>
