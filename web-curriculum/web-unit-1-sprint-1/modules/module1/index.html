      <h2>Working on a Web Application</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>Welcome to your first core competency at BloomTech, and congratulations on taking the next step in your
        professional software engineer journey! Before we dive into learning Javascript, we are going to learn about
        some technologies and tools we will use throughout the course.</p>

      <p>In an industry that can be so much in flux, it is important to have something stable, something that steadily
        grows no matter the circumstances, which is why we suggest, you always remain curious. Unlike many other
        professions, software engineering is a very dynamic field that may look very different from one job to the next,
        or from one person to the next, or even one day to the next.</p>

      <p>In this reading, you will become familiar with the essential skills of opening and editing coding files.
        Step-by-step set-up instructions are provided so you have all the tools available to learn here at BloomTech. By
        the end of this segment, you will be able to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and access an HTML file</li>
        <li>Display said HTML file in Chrome</li>
        <li>Run some Javascript code in HTML file</li>
        <li>Configure additional settings in code editor</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There is much to tackle here, so let's get started!</p>

      <h3>Here are some definition for terms you'll be seeing throughout this reading:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML:</strong> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This language is used to build webpage
          content.</li>
        <li><strong>Javascript:</strong> Javascript is a language used in web development that adds functionality to a
          page, such as responding to clicks, bringing in data from outside sources, etc</li>
        <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Google Chrome is a popular browser that includes useful tools when building
          webpages. Built by Google.</li>
        <li><strong>VSCode:</strong> VSCode is a coding program built by Microsoft, it is used for many purposes,
          including developing websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
      <p>Make sure to complete orientation!</p>

      <h3>Case Study: Washington Community Center</h3>
      <p>Welcome to your first Case Study! Throughout Module 1, we will be working alongside a Community Center,
        Washington CC where you have been hired as a software engineering teacher. Throughout this module, there will be
        different tasks and different asks. Follow up with some practice and you will be one step closer to becoming a
        professional!</p>

      <h4>Lesson Plans:</h4>
      <p>You are drafting the lesson plans for the first week of classes, which will primarily expose some of the files
        and tools they will need for the remainder of the course. It is important to not only introduce them to a HTML
        file but also to show them how that file can be managed and manipulated in a code editor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
      <h2>Opening your first web application</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>To kick off this core competency, let us first learn how to open an HTML file in Chrome and VSCode.</p>

      <p>First, copy the following into a new file in your code editor, named "index.html".
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Web App&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        console.log("Here is a small program that runs on this page.");
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                </code></pre> This file contains some basic HTML code, better known as HTML "markup," that will display
      the words "Hello, World" in any web browser. Make sure you note the location of where you download the file on
      your computer.</p>

      <h3>Opening with Chrome</h3>
      <p>The Chrome web browser can render any HTML file and display it on the screen, just like any website. You can
        open the index.html file using your Chrome browser in two ways.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>You can locate the index.html file where you saved it on your computer, right-click on it, and specify to
          open it using Chrome.</li>
        <li>You can also open Chrome first and select "Open File" from the "File" menu at the top of the page. Locate
          your file and click "Open".</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Opening with VSCode</h3>
      <p>The VSCode application will allow you to edit any HTML markup before being rendered by the Chrome browser. To
        open a file using VSCode, we recommend opening the VSCode application first. Usually, a "Get Started" page will
        appear, and you can select the option "Open". Navigate to your index.html file where you saved it on your
        computer. If this option does not appear, you can select "Open…" from the "File" menu at the top of the page and
        then navigate to your file. After doing so, you should see the following HTML markup for the index.html file:
      </p>

      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Web App&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      console.log("Here is a small program that runs on this page.");
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>Before continuing, double-check that you have enabled the "auto-save" feature by selecting it on the "File"
        menu at the top of the page. This feature will save your work each time there is a delay in your work or you
        focus away from the editor screen.</p>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>
      <p>Under normal circumstances, we will review the content of what we have just learned by returning to the case
        study introduced at the beginning of this core competency. However, since some learning objectives early in this
        course are just a half-step towards the following learning objective—like this one— they will not have a "How To
        Build It" section. Please continue with the "Practice Problems" for this learning objective.</p>

      <h3>Practice Problems</h3>
      <p>Each learning objective has its own set of practice problems. These practice problems allow you to practice
        what you have just learned in the current learning objective.</p>

      <p>Download the entire set of practice problems for the Sprint by clicking <a
          href="https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/web-s01-practice-problems/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">HERE</a>.
        (You only need to do this once per sprint.)</p>

      <p>For guidance on setting up and tackling practice problems, please watch this quick tutorial:</p>

      <h3>Accessing the JavaScript interpreter: the console</h3>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>The console is one of the most fundamental tools you will use when developing web applications. It is part of
        the Chrome browser and works like a log sheet. You can log, or print, any values from your code to the console
        by writing the following:</p>

      <pre><code>console.log("Here is a sample sentence to log.")</code></pre>

      <p>The console is also great at recording errors. If something doesn't add up in your code, the console will
        display the error and which part of your program the error originated from, also known as a "stack trace".
        Remember, an error= try again.</p>

      <p>Finally, the console runs on Javascript; thus, if you want to test any Javascript code, you can type it
        directly into the console (one part at a time) and hit "Enter".</p>

      <p>To access the console in Chrome, simply use the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Option + J on a Mac or Ctrl + Shift + J
        on Windows. When opened on our "index.html" file, it should appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Click
        to the right of the small blue greater-than sign ( >) to make the cursor appear. Then use the following command:
      </p>

      <pre><code>console.log("Hello World")</code></pre>

      <p>After pressing Return on a Mac or Enter on Windows, notice how our logged sentence printed out to the console
        on the line just below our console.log() command. You can ignore the undefined line just below it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>Adding code to a page using VS Code</h3>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>Now, let's test how the index.html file we have loaded on our VSCode application is linked with the one
        rendered in our Chrome browser. If we edit anything in the VSCode (and save it!), and then refresh the page in
        our Chrome web browser, we should see those changes reflected on the page.</p>

      <p>Let's add a new log command to our index.html file. Our old log command is between two lines with the label
        &lt;script&gt;. This location is critical. We must place any Javascript code we want to include in our web
        application between the two &lt;script&gt; labels. Since console.log() is a Javascript command, we will also
        place it between the &lt;script&gt; labels just below our existing one. Let's add console.log("This is my very
        first program!") like so:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Web App&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      console.log("Here is a small program that runs on this page.");
      console.log("This is my very first program!")
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>If we save that in VSCode and then refresh the Chrome browser, we should see a new log statement appear in the
        console along with the old one.</p>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>

      <h3>Adding a Header</h3>
      <p>Let us take what we have learned from the last three learning objectives and put them together for the web
        development project you are building with your students at Washington CC. You decide that you are going to make
        things more engaging by using an index.html file that includes the header: "Available Clubs at Washington CC".
        Here is what that file would look like in a code editor:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Washington CC&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Available Clubs At Washington CC&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>Feel free to edit the index.html file you already downloaded, or create a new one if you would like to follow
        along.</p>

      <h3>Adding Club Information in Javascript</h3>
      <p>Eventually, you would like to create a page with all the clubs' meeting times and locations. Usually,
        Javascript will load information before sending it to the HTML page. Let's simulate this by logging the
        information about the Improv Club, the Chess Club, and the Glee Club within the HTML document's &lt;script&gt;.
      </p>

      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Washington CC&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Available Clubs At Washington CC&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
     console.log(
       "The Improv Club meets every Tuesday and Thursday in the theater."
     );
     console.log(
       "The Chess Club meets every Monday and Wednesday in Room 123."
     );
     console.log(
       "The Glee Club meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in Room 321."
     );
   &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>If we open our file in the Chrome browser, we should see all three of these clubs printed to the console.</p>

      <h2>Using the console to troubleshoot problems</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The console is an excellent tool for tracking errors. Javascript will record most technical errors in the
        console. To demonstrate how the console can track these technical errors, we can try using the console.log()
        command again, but capitalizing the C of console:</p>

      <p>When doing this, we get an Reference Error: Console is not defined. This error tells us that the word, Console,
        that we tried to use hasn't been defined yet, i.e., it doesn't exist. Because words entered into Javascript are
        case-sensitive, Console.log() with a capital C doesn't equate to our pre-existing command console.log().
        Javascript can't read it, so it throws an error.</p>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>

      <p>At Washington Community Center, you would like to introduce your students to a few errors early, without
        telling them why they were caused. Continuing your list of clubs in the console, you then log the information
        for the Debate Club, but do not include the quotation marks. Here is how that would look:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Washington CC&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Available Clubs At Washington CC&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      console.log(
        "The Improv Club meets every Tuesday and Thursday in the theater."
      );
      console.log(
        "The Chess Club meets every Monday and Wednesday in Room 123."
      );
      console.log(
        "The Glee Club meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in Room 321."
      );
      console.log(The Debate Club will meet every Monday, no Tuesday, no Monday.)
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>This mistake would cause a Syntax Error and suggests it is missing a closed parenthesis ). This is a good
        suggestion by the console, but we know the issue is that it is missing quotation marks. This is a good example
        of when the console might be off when suggesting a fix, but still gives us enough information to point us in the
        right direction of what went wrong.</p>

      <h2>Adding comments to the code</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>One of the most valuable programming language features is the ability to write comments alongside your code.
        Comments are written notes by the developer that exist in the code write-up but do not get read when the program
        runs.</p>

      <p>Developers use comments as notes for either themselves or other developers. Comments can be directions or
        clarifications for other developers who might have trouble interpreting the code. Comments can also be personal
        notes that a developer might make when debugging code. Or, and this is very common, comments might be code that
        is not being used now, but is important enough to keep around in case future circumstances call for it.</p>

      <p>To write one-line comments in Javascript, we add two slashes // before any text that you want to include as a
        comment, better known as "comment out", as in:</p>

      <pre><code>console.log("Hello, World") // prints out "Hello, World"</code></pre>

      <p>The comment above, // prints out "Hello, World", lets us know that Hello, World will print out to the console,
        but it won't actually be run by the program.</p>

      <p>Side note, in VSCode, you can also use a keyboard shortcut Command + / on a Mac to add double slashes, //, or
        Ctrl + / on Windows to a line; or you can highlight several lines you want to comment out and press Command + K
        + C on a Mac or Ctrl + K + C on Windows.</p>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>

      <p>Commenting on Undecided Clubs</p>
      <p>Let's return to your work on crafting the website you are building with your students that will display all the
        active clubs at Washington CC. Let's continue by adding a few more clubs, ASB (Associated Student Body) and the
        math club; but since these clubs still need to decide on location and times, we will comment them out for now.
        Here is how that would look:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Washington CC&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Available Clubs At Washington CC&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      console.log(
        "The Improv Club meets every Tuesday and Thursday in the theater."
      );
      console.log(
        "The Chess Club meets every Monday and Wednesday in Room 123."
      );
      console.log(
        "The Glee Club meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in Room 321."
      );
      console.log(
        "The debate club will meet every Monday, no Tuesday, no Monday."
      );
      // console.log("ASB will meet...")
      // console.log("The Math Club will meet...")
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>Notice the double slashes // before the last two logs, which commented out those lines.</p>

      <p>Commenting on Club Presidents</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you would also like to keep track of the president's name for each club; however, since you do not
        care to display the name on the website, you decide to include the president's name as a comment instead. Here
        is how we could do that:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Washington CC&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Available Clubs At Washington CC&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      console.log(
        "The Improv Club meets every Tuesday and Thursday in the theater."
      ); // President: Wayne Brady
      console.log(
        "The Chess Club meets every Monday and Wednesday in Room 123."
      ); // President: Magnus Carlsen
      console.log(
        "The Glee Club meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in Room 321."
      ); // President: Lea Michele
      console.log(
        "The debate club will meet every Monday, no Tuesday, no Monday."
      ); // President: undecided
      // console.log("ASB will meet...")
      // console.log("The Math Club will meet...")
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>Notice how our comments can be on the same line as the code the browser will read.</p>

      <h2>Formatting code automatically</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>When a browser reads code, it will read it character-by-character and line-by-line and disregard spaces or
        indentations. However, formatting code to include spaces and indentations makes it more readable to you and
        other developers. Luckily, VSCode has a built-in feature that automatically formats your code when it saves a
        file. Understanding what this format looks like is not necessary to memorize. With auto-formatting, how things
        get placed will become more familiar as time goes on.</p>

      <p>Here is an example of a really poorly formatted version of the index.html we have been working on:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web App&lt;/title&gt;
                            &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
                      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      console.log("Here is a small program that runs on this page.");
                console.log("This is my very first program!");

    &lt;/script&gt;
                    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>And after saving this file with the auto-format feature enabled, we get a much more readable, organized look:
      </p>

      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Web App&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      console.log("Here is a small program that runs on this page.");
      console.log("This is my very first program!");
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>One final note: sometimes, when you save a file and expect it to auto-format, it doesn't. This can seem
        puzzling at first, but this usually means you have an error in your code, and the auto-format feature can't
        figure out where to place everything if there are errors on the page. First, find and fix the error, and then
        the auto-format feature should work again.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In this core competency, we introduced a lot of the tools, and some tricks of the trade software developers use
        on daily web applications. We first learned how to open HTML files with the Chrome browser, and how to edit
        those files in VSCode. We practiced logging information in the console and understanding different scenarios for
        why that would be important. We also practiced making comments in Javascript and discussed why those are
        important to a developer's everyday life.</p>

      <p>This first core competency will feel slightly different from the rest. It introduces a lot of add-ons, without
        getting into much of the nuts and bolts of Javascript. If you need help understanding the need for some of these
        add-ons, their value will only become more evident as we embark on actual Javascript content in the following
        core competency.</p>

      <h2>Values</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Boiled down to its simplest parts, Javascript is all about values: creating them, storing them, updating them,
        moving them, utilizing them, and even, forgetting them.</p>

      <p>They are much like the cells of the human body, each having their own identity and purpose. But, when you get
        enough of them together performing the same function as muscle cells would pump blood in the heart, they take on
        a newer, more prominent sense of purpose that can make an application shine. Though, in the end, if you break it
        down, all that remains are values.</p>

      <p>There are many different types of values used in Javascript, each with their own pros and cons, all of which we
        will cover in due time.</p>

      <p>In this reading, we will focus on some of the most fundamental values, better known as primitive types, and
        introduce some ways we can use them.</p>

      <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
      <p>Exposure to the Console</p>

      <h3>Case Study:</h3>
      <p>What is web development without Javascript, the language that controls the logic of it all? It is time for us
        to return to the project you are creating for your software engineering students at Washington Community Center.
        So far, you have done great work setting up the HTML file your students will use to start building their
        school's website on available clubs and logging the information for some of those clubs in the console. Now it
        is time to work with some of the value types needed for this project: strings, numbers, booleans, and even,
        undefined.</p>

      <h2>Using arithmetic operators</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Most web applications do not require heavy math skills, but basic arithmetic is almost always needed. Most of
        the logic and symbols used for mathematical expressions in Javascript is the same as you expect to see on paper.
      </p>

      <p>Here are some commonly used arithmetic operations:</p>

      <h4>Arithmetic Operations Chart</h4>
      <p>Operation: +, -, *, /, **, %</p>
      <p>Description: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponentiation, Remainder</p>

      <p>And here are some examples of how these arithmetic operations might be employed:</p>

      <pre><code>2 + 3 // expression that evaluates to number 5.
1 + 2 + 3 // another longer expression evaluating to number 6
5 - 6.5 // this expression evaluates to number -1.5 (minus one point five)

2 * 3 // using the multiplication operator, this expression evaluates to number 6
10 / 2 // evaluates to number 5
10 / 3 // evaluates to number 3.3333333333333335

3**3 // evaluates to 27.  The double asterisk, "**", is the exponential operator.  3 * 3 * 3 = 27 
16 % 5 // evaluates to 1.  The '%' symbol returns the remainder of the two numbers divided. 16/5 = 3, with a remainder of 1.</code></pre>

      <p>Remember that the console in your Chrome browser runs on Javascript. If you try any of these expressions in
        your console, you should expect to see some answers!</p>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>
      <p>Similar to what we did in the previous section, you hope to plan for some of the mathematical expressions you
        and your students expect to see in your web application.</p>

      <p>A possible feature involving a mathematical expression is "club capacity". You would like to show a capacity
        bar for each club that shows how full the club is of current members at a given time. Here is how that would
        look.</p>

      <p>You would first need to set up an expression using a division operator:</p>

      <p>Current Members / Total Capacity</p>
      <p>For example:</p>

      <pre><code>8 / 25 // evaluates to 0.32</code></pre>

      <p>You would then need to convert that number into a percent by using the multiplication operator, like so:</p>

      <pre><code>0.32 * 100 // evaluates to 32</code></pre>

      <p>This is the final number, added with a "%" sign that you could include next to each listed club on the website.
        Ideally, when a member is added or dropped, the Javascript code will re-run and a new percent would be
        displayed.</p>

      <h2>Joining strings with the + operator</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>As we continue along with the course, we will learn dozens of ways to manipulate strings. Among them is the "+"
        operator, which joins or "concatenates" two strings together. Much like in math, where a "+" operator is used to
        add a number, when used with strings, we can also say that the two strings are being added together. This is an
        extremely common operator to use when working with strings.</p>

      <p>Here are some examples:</p>

      <pre><code>"String One" + "String Two" // expression evaluates to "StringOneStringTwo"; note that no space between the two strings was added
"String One " + "String Two" // expression evaluates to "StringOne StringTwo" a space was added between both strings because it was included in the first string.
"StringOne" + " " + "StringTwo" // expression also evaluates to "StringOne StringTwo" but added the space between the strings as its own string</code></pre>

      <p>In some cases you can also use the "+" operator to combine different types of primitive values, but this is
        rare and often discouraged.</p>

      <p>Here is an example:</p>

      <pre><code>5 + "" // evaluates to the string '5'. It's one way to turn numbers into strings. Converting between types is often called "casting".
"Number" + 5 // evaluates to the string: 'Number5'. Other, more rigid programming languages would throw an error instead.</code></pre>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>
      <p>Let us return to our case study on the website you are building with the students of Washington Community
        Center. Remember that we determined that each listed club would have three separate strings of information: a
        club name, meeting dates, and a meeting location. Similar to what you logged in the console earlier, we would
        like to display each of these in one simple sentence for students to read. We can use the "+" operator to
        concatenate these three strings together. Here is how that would look with a few clubs:</p>

      <pre><code>"The Improv Club" + " meets every" + " Tuesday and Thursday" + " in the Theater" // will result to: "The Improv Club meets every Tuesday and Thursday in the Theater"

"The Chess Club" + " meets every" + " Monday and Wednesday" + " in Room 123"  // will result to "The Chess Club meets every Monday and Wednesday in Room 123"

"The Glee Club" + " meets every" + " Monday, Wednesday, and Friday" + " in Room 321" // will result to "The Glee Club meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in Room 321"</code></pre>

      <h2>Determining type with the typeof operator</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>More often than not, determining the type of a value is obvious: 24 is a number, "String" is a string, etc.
        But, there are situations when the type of a value may not be so obvious. Luckily, we have the typeof operator.
        The "typeof" operator, when placed before a value, returns the data type of that value.</p>

      <p>Here are some examples:</p>

      <pre><code>typeof 'I am a sentence.' // prints 'string'
typeof "Washington CC" // prints 'string'
typeof 24 // prints 'number'
typeof "25" // prints 'string'. It may look like a number, but notice those quotes!
typeof undefined // prints 'undefined'
typeof "" // an empty string is still a 'string'!</code></pre>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>
      <p>You would not like to show your students this useful tool with some of the values you expect to encounter when
        building your web application. You ask your students to type in each one in the console preceded by the typeof
        operator to confirm their value types.</p>

      <p>Here are some examples:</p>

      <pre><code>typeof "The Improv Club" // prints 'string'
typeof 'Monday and Wednesday' // prints 'string'
typeof 8 // prints 'number'
typeof 8/25 // prints NaN
typeof (8/25) // prints 'number'
typeof undefined // prints 'undefined'</code></pre>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In this core competency, we learned about Javascript's most fundamental building block: value. We learned about
        different primitive value types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, even undefined values, and how to check the
        type of any value using the typeof operator. We also learned how to modify those values with arithmetic
        operators. Finally, we learned how to concatenate and combine strings together with the "+" operator. This was
        our first dabble with fundamental Javascript. Values will only seem more understandable as they are given more
        and more context.</p>

      <h2>Variables</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>In our last core competency, we discussed how the nuts and bolts of web development work with values. But using
        values only as standalone items would require a developer to edit code each time a user wanted to change
        anything on the website, like changing one's status on a profile page. Thus, perhaps the most convenient thing
        you can do with values is to store them where they can be easily accessed and modified in other parts of the
        program.</p>

      <p>In Javascript, any value type can be stored in something called a variable. Think of a variable as a type of
        container, specifically a food container. A food container can be manufactured and continue to exist without
        food; so can variables without values. But the intention of manufacturing food containers is to hold food, same
        with variables and values. Furthermore, some food containers are designed for one-time use, like zip-lock bags
        (mostly). Other food containers, like tupperware, are designed to be used multiple times for multiple types of
        food. In the same way, we have variables in Javascript that can only hold one value, period. While others are
        designed to hold multiple values at once, and even others are designed to hold multiple values too, albeit one
        at a time.</p>

      <p>In this reading, you will learn how to create variables in Javascript and how to give those variables values.
        You will also learn which types of variables can be changed and how to go about changing them.</p>

      <h3>Case Study: Washington CC Clubs</h3>
      <p>We are embarking on the third leg of our case study where you are a recently hired software engineering teacher
        at Washington Community Center. You and your students have been putting the early touches on your new web
        application that will eventually list all the current student clubs at Washington CC and information about each
        club's meeting times and location, as well as, member capacity. We have done a deep dive into exploring the
        types of values that we would expect to see when developing such a project: strings, numbers, booleans, and
        even, undefined values. It is now time to finally make those values more accessible to the rest of the
        application by storing them in variables that can either be referenced later or updated.</p>

      <h2>Declaring a variable with let</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <h4>Declaring let Variables and Assigning Them Values</h4>
      <p>Some variables are purposely designed to hold values that may change, or update, over time. We create, better
        known as "declare", these variables by using the keyword let in front of the name you want to use for your
        variable. Here is how you would declare a variable using let and assign it a number value:</p>

      <pre><code>let myNumber = 45 // noticed keyword "let" followed by a variable name, an equal sign, and the value</code></pre>

      <p>Notice above we first have the required let keyword followed by the name of the variable, which is entirely up
        to you. These two parts are all you need to declare the variable. If you then want to immediately assign that
        variable a value, then you would include the equal sign, =, followed by the value itself. In the example above,
        we have a number value, but you can assign any type of value to a variable. Here are a few more examples with
        other value types:</p>

      <pre><code>let sampleWord = "Washington" // variable assigned to a string
let sampleSentence = "I am a sample sentence." // variable assigned to another string
let currentValue = undefined // variable assigned to an "undefined" value
let isOpen = false // variable assigned to a boolean value</code></pre>

      <h4>Declaring let Variables without Values</h4>
      <p>As mentioned before, declaring a variable using let only requires the let keyword and the variable name.
        Sometimes, it is useful to only declare a variable and not immediately assign it a value, like so:</p>

      <pre><code>let sampleWord</code></pre>

      <p>You can then later assign that variable a value by using the variable name followed by the equal sign, =, and
        the value itself, as in:</p>

      <pre><code>sampleWord = "Washington"</code></pre>

      <p>Notice how we did not include the let keyword here. Once the variable has already been declared, there is no
        reason to use let again for that same variable.</p>

      <p>Variables that have been declared with let, can be reassigned values in the same way:</p>

      <pre><code>sampleWord = "Pumpkin"</code></pre>

      <p>Now, whenever the variable sampleWord is referenced, it no longer has the value of Washington, it has the value
        of Pumpkin.</p>

      <h4>Updating Values To let Variables</h4>
      <p>You can also reassign variables to themselves and add something more. This is particularly common with numbers,
        if you wanted to reassign a variable to its same value but, let's say, add one more. For example:</p>

      <pre><code>let myNumber = 45 // declaring variable "myNumber" and assigning it to a value of 45

myNumber = myNumber + 1 // "myNumber" now has a value of 46</code></pre>

      <p>You can also do this with strings:</p>

      <pre><code>let myString = "My favorite food is "
myString = myString + "pizza." // "myString" now has a value of "My favorite food is pizza."</code></pre>

      <p>Returning back to numbers, there is also a very commonly used shortcut to add one or more to a value, or
        subtract. You would simply state the variable name then add += to add, or -= to subtract, followed by the value
        you would like to add or subtract. Here are some examples:</p>

      <pre><code>let myNumber = 45
myNumber += 5 // adds the value of "myNumber" by 5 to 50

let myNumber = 45
myNumber -= 5 // subtracts the value of "myNumber" by 5 to 40</code></pre>

      <p>And finally, if you are looking to just add or subtract one to your number value, there is even a shorter
        shortcut that uses the operator ++ to add, or -- to subtract:</p>

      <pre><code>let myNumber = 45
myNumber++ // adds one to the value of "myNumber"; now equals 46</code></pre>

      <h4>Redeclaring Variables</h4>
      <p>One last important note. You can not redeclare a variable within the same block of code.</p>

      <pre><code>let myString = "This Works."
let myString = "This Fails." // declaring "myString" twice will result in an error</code></pre>

      <p>If this happens, you can either choose a different variable name to declare, or omit the keyword let and then
        you would be reassigning that variable to a new value.</p>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>
      <p>Let's return to our case study where you are in the middle of planning out the early steps to a website with
        your students at Washington CC. It is time we consider which values in our website will need to be stored in let
        variables.</p>

      <p>One value, the most obvious one, is the number of members each club currently has. Your most resourceful
        students have just informed you that the improv club currently has 8 members, the chess club has 16 members, and
        the glee club has 22 members. Here is what that might look like:</p>

      <pre><code>let improvMemberCount = 8
let chessMemberCount = 16
let gleeMemberCount = 22</code></pre>

      <p>Well done, but shortly after guiding your class through declaring these variables, you have just received word
        that the improv club has added two members, and the glee club has lost four members. Updating those values would
        require either of the the following formats:</p>

      <pre><code>improvMemberCount = improvMemberCount + 2 // reassign value of "improvMemberCount" to two more

gleeMemberCount -= 4 // reassign value of "gleeMemberCount" to four less</code></pre>

      <p>A second value that we should store in a let variable is one we referred to earlier when we were speculating
        possible boolean values this application might need. Perhaps it would be a nice feature if presidents of each
        club could toggle their club between active and inactive, in case there was a stretch of the school year when
        the club couldn't meet. This feature could be controlled by a simple boolean value that can switch between true
        and false. With this ongoing change we will need to use a let variable to store this value:</p>

      <pre><code>let isActive = true // declaring a variable "isActive" and assigning it a boolean value of "true"</code></pre>

      <p>Now whenever a president of a club wants to make their club inactive, they can click a button that would then
        trigger the following:</p>

      <pre><code>isActive = false</code></pre>

      <p>In turn, this would prevent students from seeing the club among the active clubs list.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
      <h2>Declaring a variable with const</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>In addition to let, variables can be declared using the keyword const followed by the variable name. As the
        name implies, a variable that has been declared with the keyword const, short for "constant", can not be
        changed. And since it can not be changed, it must be assigned a value when the variable is declared.</p>

      <pre><code>const myNumber = 45 // assigning a constant variable to the value 45

const sampleWord = "Washington" // assigning a constant variable to the value of "Washington"</code></pre>

      <p>To reiterate, if we were to try and reassign a value for one of these constants, as in:</p>

      <pre><code>const myNumber = 45 // declaring a const variable
myNumber = 46 // reassigning value, throws error</code></pre>

      <p>…we would receive a Type Error because the type of variable we are trying to change is a constant and can not
        be changed by definition.</p>

      <p>The same rule applies when using shortcuts to add values to numbers, as in:</p>

      <pre><code>const myNumber = 45
myNumber++ // will still throw an error because myNumber is being changed.</code></pre>

      <p>To get around this problem, you would have to declare another variable to save that new value:</p>

      <pre><code>const myNumber = 45
const newNumber = myNumber++</code></pre>

      <p>Including const variables can be necessary for a program that needs to save important, unchanging values to a
        variable but wants to avoid accidentally changing those values later. This is actually a more common mistake
        than you might think, as many different components of programs could be worked on simultaneously by different
        developers who are all creating variables with names that describe similar values, like num for "number", or
        userName for a user's name.</p>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>
      <p>Let us continue working on the web application you are building with your students at Washington CC. You just
        got out of a staff meeting during which you were notified that, for safety reasons, all student clubs could only
        have a maximum of 25 students. Knowing that this number will not change from club to club, this would be an
        excellent opportunity for a const variable:</p>

      <pre><code>const maxStudentCount = 25</code></pre>

      <p>The upside to declaring a const variable here is that it would prevent the future possibility of changing the
        maximum capacity of students for each club, so long as this variable is used where it needs to be.</p>

      <p>For example, let's now return to the math expression we previously created to calculate our club capacity:</p>

      <p>Current Members / Total Capacity</p>

      <p>In the last "How To Build It" section, we created a variable to hold the ever-fluctuating numbers of members in
        our three trial clubs:</p>

      <pre><code>let improvMemberCount = 8
let chessMemberCount = 16
let gleeMemberCount = 22</code></pre>

      <p>Let us use just the Improv Club as an example. We can now take the improvMemberCount variable and divide it by
        the maxStudentCountvariable for this math expression:</p>

      <pre><code>let improvMemberCount = 8
const maxStudentCount = 25

improvMemberCount / maxStudentCount * 100 // evaluates to 32, as in 32% capacity</code></pre>

      <p>And now, if we were to update the number of members of the Improv Class to two more, we can reassign its
        variable to a value that is two more:</p>

      <pre><code>let improvMemberCount = 8
const maxStudentCount = 25

improvMemberCount += 2

improvMemberCount / maxStudentCount * 100 // now evaluates to 40, as in "40% capacity"</code></pre>

      <h2>Printing variables to the console</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>If at any point in the program, we need to know what value is stored inside a variable, we can use
        console.log() to print the value to the console.</p>

      <pre><code>const myNumber = 45
console.log(myNumber) // prints 45</code></pre>

      <p>This can be a very useful tool to keep track of which values your variables have at any point in your program,
        much like a checkpoint. If the values you print are what you expect, then it is a good indicator that you are
        still in control of how you are managing information in your program. This strategy is a very common practice
        used by developers; otherwise, you will be writing your entire program blind and hoping that it all works in the
        end.</p>

      <p>Here is a quick example. Let's say we wanted to combine a first and last name for specific parts of our
        program. We might have something like this:</p>

      <pre><code>let firstName = "Sophia" // declaring first name variable and assigning value of "Sophia"
let lastName = "Papadopoulos" // declaring last name variable and assigning value of "Sophia"

let fullName = firstName + lastName // concatenating values of first and last name variable
console.log(fullName) // prints "SophiaPapadopoulos"</code></pre>

      <p>This is a great example of why you would want to use console.log() to check the values of your variable before
        continuing. By checking the value of fullName we can see that we did not include a space between the first and
        last names, as we might expect. In this case, we could change our fullName value to the following:</p>

      <pre><code>let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName // concatenating values of first and last name variable
console.log(fullName) // now prints "Sophia Papadopoulos"</code></pre>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>
      <p>In our previous "How To Build It" section we utilized some of our newly declared variables to calculate the
        member capacity of the improv club. We understood that the current number of members for each club changes, and
        thus was first declared with the keyword let.</p>

      <p>Here is where we left off:</p>

      <pre><code>let improvMemberCount = 8
const maxStudentCount = 25

improvMemberCount += 2

improvMemberCount / maxStudentCount * 100</code></pre>

      <p>At this point, without logging anything to the console, we would have no idea whether our code actually
        performed the way we would expect. To check our work here, lets log the value of improvMemberCount both before
        and after two members were added, like so:</p>

      <pre><code>let improvMemberCount = 8
const maxStudentCount = 25

console.log(improvMemberCount) // prints 8

improvMemberCount += 2

console.log(improvMemberCount) // now prints 10</code></pre>

      <p>By logging these values to the console, we can ensure that our code is executing as expected. And if at any
        point something didn't add up, say, the second log still printed 8, we could more easily find the problem and
        fix it.</p>

      <p>Finally, wouldn't it also be nice to determine if the math expression we used to calculate the current capacity
        works too? To do this, we can simply save that math expression in its own variable using let or const, and the
        printing that variable to the console too:</p>

      <pre><code>const currentCapacity = improvMemberCount / maxStudentCount * 100
console.log(currentCapacity) // prints 40, as in 40% capacity</code></pre>

      </div>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In this core competency, we learned about two different ways to declare a variable, using let or const.
        Remember that let allows us to reassign a value to that variable later in the program, but const does not, and
        requires a value to be assigned when declared. We also learned how to log variables to the console, and, thus,
        their values. Storing values to variables we can then call later in a program is essential to keeping track of
        our values, sorting them, and updating them, which we will see more of in future readings.</p>

      <p>Stay sharp, stay curious, and remember, if you happen to use variables incorrectly, the console will kindly let
        you know.</p>

      <h2>Comparison and Logic</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>A typical tool career counselors give to their clients is an aptitude test, or skills test, which gives them
        some indication of which career fields their client might initially find success in. Inevitably, these tests
        utilize a lot of comparative logic: "if this… then that" or "if this and this… then that instead", and so on.
        Comparative expressions such as these, help construct a profile of an individual's strengths and weaknesses and
        then determine some best-fit careers based on that profile. For example, if a person tests at a high level in
        interpersonal skills but low in analysis, then they might suggest a teacher but not a psychologist; whereas, if
        a person tests well in mathematics but not leadership, then they might suggest an engineer, but not a project
        manager.</p>

      <p>Although an aptitude test like this is an obvious example of something that uses comparative logic, you will
        find that every program that you develop will need comparative logic to function.</p>

      <p>This reading will cover all the fundamental operators used to make logical comparisons of values in Javascript,
        and how we can combine multiple operators to build more complex comparisons.</p>

      <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
      <p>Primitive Values</p>

      <h3>Case Study: Washington CC</h3>
      <p>It is our final case study involving your role as a software engineering instructor at Washington CC. You have
        spent quite a few days introducing your students to the important tools, values, and variables you will use when
        developing your website on active clubs found at the school. We have already encountered a few scenarios, such
        as determining when a user is logged in and whether a club has reached its total member capacity. These would be
        good candidates to introduce comparative logic, and we will see how this works in the upcoming learning
        objectives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
      <h2>Mastering the comparison operators</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Comparison operators are used to compare two values to determine whether a condition is true or false. Here are
        the most commonly used comparison operators:</p>

      <h4>Strict Equal ===</h4>
      <pre><code>5 === 5 // true
5 === 3 + 3 // false
"JavaScript" === "JavaScript" // true
" hello " === "hello" // false, whitespace matters!
"hello " + "world" === "hello world" // true</code></pre>

      <h4>Strict Not Equal !==</h4>
      <pre><code>5 !== 5 // false
5 !== "5" // true
"Hello World" !== "hello world" // true, case matters!
"" !== '' // false, single quotes and double quotes work the same</code></pre>

      <h4>Greater Than >, Less Than << /h4>
          <pre><code>5 > 4 // true
5 > 4 + 1 // false
4 < 5 // true
1 + 1 < 2 // false</code></pre>

          <h4>Greater Than Or Equal >=, Less Than Or Equal <=< /h4>
              <pre><code>5 >= 5 // true
1 >= -100 // true
-100 >= 100 // false
1 <= 1 // true</code></pre>

              <p>In the grand scheme, it is essential to remember that these conditions will almost always trigger
                separate actions by the program depending on whether the condition is true or false. If a website only
                wants to show specific content to logged-in users, the site will check if the user is logged in to
                determine what to display. If a user wants to see only emails from a specific individual, the site will
                check each email to see if the sender matches the given email address.</p>

              <p>As a side note, there also exists a loose equal operator with only two equal signs == instead of three,
                but it comes with behaviors you might not expect. Please avoid using this operator for now.</p>

              <h3>How to Build it</h3>
              <p>Let us return to the web application you are developing with your students at Washington CC. You
                noticed in your earlier work that your website would use a boolean value for whether a student was
                logged in. This logged-in value will determine if students should access different site features, like
                joining a club.</p>

              <p>Let's create a simple comparison that will render true or false depending on whether a student is
                logged in:</p>

              <pre><code>isStudentLoggedIn === true // might be true or false depending on if a student is logged in</code></pre>

              <p>In this example, we used the pre-existing variable name isStudentLoggedIn and assigned it a value of
                true.</p>

              <p>Another example of where we could use some comparative logic is with our member capacity calculator for
                each club. Let us say that we would like to ultimately change the color of the capacity bar to red if
                the capacity reaches more than twenty members out of twenty-five. We will save our red styling for a
                later time, but here is how the comparative logic would work:</p>

              <pre><code>improvMemberCount > 20 // true or false depending on if members are greater than or less than/equal to 20</code></pre>

      <h2>Solving logical expressions</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>It is common for one condition to require multiple, smaller conditions, each with their own comparisons of
        different values.</p>

      <p>When faced with complicated decision trees in Javascript, we can resolve these problems by connecting
        conditional statements using two specialized operators to separate each logical expression:</p>

      <h4>The "AND" operator, &&, in which BOTH expressions must be true for the entire condition to be true.</h4>
      <pre><code>(1 < 2) && (2 < 3) // true, because both sides of the && are true
(1 < 2) && (2 === 3) // false, because one side of the && is false
(1 < 2) && ('7' === 7) // false, because one side of the && is false
false && true // false, because one side of the && is false
(7 !== '7') && (100 !== -100) // true
(2 <= 2) && (3 < 4) // true</code></pre>

      <h4>The "OR" operator, ||, in which only ONE expression must be true for the entire condition to be true.</h4>
      <pre><code>(2 > 3) || (4 > 2) // true, because one side of the || is true
true || false // true, because one side of the || is true
false || true // true, because one side of the || is true
('Java' === 'JavaScript') || (7 === '7') // false, because both sides of the || are false
(5 >= -100) || false  // true, because the left side of the || is true</code></pre>

      <p>As you can see from these examples, we can create conditions that involve multiple comparisons of entirely
        different values that will return a single boolean value, true or false, for the whole thing.</p>

      <p>One final thing worth noting here concerns how we write these conditions. The parenthesis around each
        expression, as seen above, is optional. Removing them would not hamper the program's ability to run correctly,
        but including them is easier for developers to read and are commonly used.</p>

      <h3>How to Build it</h3>
      <p>As we continue developing our application for active clubs at Washington CC, we can find valuable ways to
        include some multi-part conditional statements. Take, for instance, the logged-in logical comparison we
        established in the last "How To Build It" section. What if we wanted to provide even more features specifically
        for club presidents, like editing club information? Of course, we still want to ensure that the student is
        logged in, but now, let's add another condition where the student has to be logged in and be the president.
        Checking these conditions would be a great use of our "AND" operator, &&, and could look something like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code>isStudentLoggedIn && isStudentRolePresident // true only if both are true</code></pre>

      <p>Let us return to our member capacity calculator. Checking capacity and notifying users if it's full is an
        excellent opportunity to add an "OR" operator, ||. Let's say we wanted the capacity bar to disappear if the club
        is full of members or has been marked inactive. Here is how the comparative logic of that scenario might look
        for the improv club:</p>

      <pre><code>(improvMemberCount === 25) || (isImprovClubActive === false)</code></pre>

      <p>As we can see in this conditional statement, if either the number of members of the improv club is at total
        capacity (25) or the club is not active, this condition will render true. Else, it would render false.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>This core competency taught us how to apply comparative logic to our values and variables. We learned that
        using comparative operators, like === or >=, can, in turn, tell us whether a condition is true or false. We also
        learned that real applications can be pretty complex in comparative logic and would need some version comparing
        multiple conditions using the && and || operators. It might be best to think of complex comparative logic much
        like a decision tree. If you feel overwhelmed by any of it, try mapping out your logic in a decision tree before
        applying it to Javascript. And remember, you always have the help of your instructors and peers should you need
        it.</p>
