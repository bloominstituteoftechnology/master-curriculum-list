        <h2>Understanding Stateful Logic</h2>
        <p>Stateful logic is logic that is built into a component. For example, it can be a function that handles a
          click event, a function that sets a toggle state, or a function that formats data before it gets displayed.
          Usually, this kind of logic deals with state in the component. Thus the moniker "stateful logic."</p>
        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>
          <p>Look at this component. Can you spot the stateful logic built into it?</p>

          <pre><code>import React, { useState } from "react";

const DynamicTitle = () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState("Hooks are so fun!");
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");

  const handleChanges = e => {
    setInputText(e.target.value);
  };

  const changeTitle = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setTitle(inputText);
    setInputText("");
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="Wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;h1 className="Title"&gt;{title}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;form onSubmit={changeTitle}&gt;
        &lt;div className="Input"&gt;
          &lt;input
            className="Input-text"
            id="input"
            name="inputText"
            onChange={handleChanges}
            placeholder="Create new title"
            type="text"
            value={inputText}
          /&gt;
          &lt;label htmlFor="input" className="Input-label"&gt;
            New title
          &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default DynamicTitle;</code></pre>

          <p>You are probably looking at the two functions - handleChanges and changeTitle. If so, that is correct! And
            we can probably also count the title and inputText state in there as well. Those are all great examples of
            stateful logic. The sky's the limit on what could be considered stateful logic in a React component.</p>

        <h2>Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks</h2>
        <p>Custom hooks are called this because you are building the hook yourself (customizing it) to apply non-visual
          behavior and stateful logic throughout your components. This way, you can reuse the same hook over and over
          again. In addition, custom hooks follow the same naming patterns that you've already learned (i.e., prefacing
          the function name with use, as in useState). Thus, you can build a reusable custom hook for anything from
          handling controlled inputs to managing event listeners or watching for key presses.</p>
        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>
          <p>Let's start with the same component that we evaluated in the objective above. Go ahead and look over it one
            more time, this time making sure to understand what the various parts are doing.</p>

          <pre><code>import React, { useState } from "react";

const DynamicTitle = () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState("This is a class component");
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");

  const handleChanges = e => {
    setInputText(e.target.value);
  };

  const changeTitle = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setTitle(inputText);
    setInputText("");
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="Wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;h1 className="Title"&gt;{title}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;form onSubmit={changeTitle}&gt;
        &lt;div className="Input"&gt;
          &lt;input
            className="Input-text"
            id="input"
            name="inputText"
            onChange={handleChanges}
            placeholder="Create new title"
            type="text"
            value={inputText}
          /&gt;
          &lt;label htmlFor="input" className="Input-label"&gt;
            New title
          &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default DynamicTitle;</code></pre>

          <p>See how we have a useState hook, a handleChange function to update based on any changes, and a changeTitle
            function to change the actual title of the component when we submit the form?</p>

          <p>Now, what happens if we need to issue state for multiple input tags? If we were to follow the lead of the
            patterns shown above, we would end up having to rewrite large amounts of our code for each useState call
            that we've invoked in order to create state for our second, third, and fourth inputs.</p>

          <p>Instead, let's build out our custom hook to reuse stateful logic. In this way, we avoid repeating code
            unnecessarily. Read the following function and try to guess what each piece of code is doing:</p>

          <pre><code>export const useInput = initialValue => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
  const handleChanges = updatedValue => {
    setValue(updatedValue);
  };
  return [value, setValue, handleChanges];
};</code></pre>

          <p>In this useInput custom hook function, we're taking in an initialValue and returning three new values. We
            pass initialValue as a parameter on the function. initialValue is then passed into the useState hook, which
            returns an array with our value variable and setValue function (just the same as what you've used up to this
            point).</p>

          <p>Next, we have a handleChanges function that uses the setValue function to update state to a new value.
            Finally, we return an array from our useInput custom hook containing the value variable, the setValue
            function, and the handleChanges function.</p>

          <p>Let's take a look at this custom hook when it's imported and used in a component.</p>

          <pre><code>import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useInput } from "./useInput.js";

const CustomForm = () => {
  const [username, setUsername, handleUsername] = useInput("");
  const [password, setPassword, handlePassword] = useInput("");
  const [email, setEmail, handleEmail] = useInput("");

  const resetValues = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setUsername("");
    setPassword("");
    setEmail("");
  };

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={resetValues}&gt;
      &lt;input
        className="username-text"
        id="username"
        name="username"
        onChange={e => handleUsername(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Username"
        type="text"
        value={username}
      /&gt;
      &lt;input
        className="password-test"
        id="password"
        name="password"
        onChange={e => handlePassword(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Password"
        type="password"
        value={password}
      /&gt;
      &lt;input
        className="email-text"
        id="email"
        name="email"
        onChange={e => handleEmail(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Email"
        type="text"
        value={email}
      /&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
};

export default CustomForm;</code></pre>

          <p>Whoa. That looks crazy, right? Don't worry. We're going to dissect this whole script to figure out exactly
            what each part is doing.</p>

          <p>First off, notice that we're invoking the useInput custom hook three times at the top of the component and
            passing in an empty string as each one's initial value:</p>

          <pre><code>const [username, setUsername, handleUsername] = useInput("");
const [password, setPassword, handlePassword] = useInput("");
const [email, setEmail, handleEmail] = useInput("");</code></pre>

          <p>Our useInput hook returns a new copy of our custom hook and state each time. Also, because array
            destructuring is based on positioning and not the name, we are allowed by JavaScript to name each of the
            three items returned from useInput in different ways. This is why we can set the first item to username, the
            second to setUsername, and the third to handleUsername while the next two useInput calls return
            differently-named variables and functions.</p>

          <p>From these invocations, it now becomes easy to rig up each of our input tags in our JSX just the same as we
            did before.</p>

          <p>Notice how we are setting our handleUsername, handlePassword, and handleEmail functions to process changes
            to the input. Remember how we returned a handleChanges function from our custom hook? Well, we've renamed
            them here (again, thanks to array destructuring) and are using them just the same as before. However, now,
            we have less code for them in our component.</p>

          <p>The final thing you should notice is the resetValue function. When we invoke it, we use the setValues
            returned from each useInput (again, each one is named differently) and pass it in our reset value (in this
            case, an empty string). Isn't this an easy way to change your state?</p>

        <h2>Composing Hooks</h2>
        <p>Just as we can compose functions in vanilla JavaScript and components in React to create new functionality,
          we can extend our stateful logic by combining several hooks in a powerful, single custom hook. In addition,
          using custom hooks allow us to build out interesting, reusable actions by combining various hooks in our
          application.</p>
        <p>We can develop this complexity using multiple hooks inside a single custom hook. We've done this already when
          we called <code>useState</code> inside <code>useInput</code>. Pretty cool! Now imagine writing several custom
          hooks and combining all of that logic into a single custom hook to use in your components. The possibilities
          are endless! Isn't it amazing?! Let's try it out by expanding the <code>useInput</code> custom hook we've
          already built.</p>
        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>
          <p>We need to start by building out a second custom hook. Later on, we'll combine it with the useInput custom
            hook from the previous objective to achieve a more compelling hook with multiple pieces of stateful logic.
          </p>

          <p>First, we'll implement the new hook that we will call useLocalStorage:</p>

          <pre><code>import { useState } from "react";

const useLocalStorage = (key, initialValue) => {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
    return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
  });
  const setValue = value => {
    setStoredValue(value);
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  };
  return [storedValue, setValue];
};</code></pre>

          <p>Let's walk through what we're doing here. First, we pass in a key-value (like: "input1," "input2" ) and an
            initialValue. These two parameters (key and value) are used in the useState hook call and used immediately
            inside our custom hooks. Instead of just passing in an initial value to this useState hook, we are using an
            anonymous arrow function as a callback to do two things:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Check if the window.localStorage has a specific item (retrieved by key) in it</li>
            <li>Return that item from local storage if it exists or the initialValue otherwise</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Because of this, our hook can now successfully check to see if a specific state item exists in
            localStorage, and it can use that item if it exists instead of the provided initialValue. Then, we also have
            a setValue function that takes a value as a parameter, sets it to the current storedValue by using the
            setStoredValue provided by useState, and sets it to localStorage. As our state is now stored, our custom
            hook will check here on refresh to see if the state exists.</p>

          <p>Now that we have a custom hook for controlling value placement (and updates) in localStorage, we can
            combine it with useInput to create powerful logic. Take a look at the completed code, and then we'll talk
            about what it's doing:</p>

          <pre><code>import { useState } from "react";

export const useInput = (key, initialValue) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useLocalStorage(key, initialValue);
  const handleChanges = updatedValue => {
    setValue(updatedValue);
  };
  return [value, setValue, handleChanges];
};

const useLocalStorage = (key, initialValue) => {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
    return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
  });
  const setValue = value => {
    setStoredValue(value);
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  };
  return [storedValue, setValue];
};</code></pre>

          <p>While our useLocalStorage hook has stayed the same, our useInput custom hook has some nice upgrades going
            on. Instead of implementing useState from React as before, we're now using useLocalStorage. Furthermore,
            we're also taking in two parameters instead of one - key and initialValue. These are then passed directly
            into the useLocalStorage hook. Immediately, the hook sets about implementing special logic with the
            variables as described above. This returns to our useInput custom hook with either a value from localStorage
            or our initialValue, and our useInput custom hook then returns a value, setValue function, and a
            handleChanges function in an array just the same as it did before.</p>

          <p>Now when we call the useInput hook in a component to control inputs dynamically, we just need to pass in a
            unique key for each input to keep track of it in localStorage. Something like this:</p>

          <pre><code>const [username, setUsername, handleUsername] = useInput("userName", "");
const [password, setPassword, handlePassword] = useInput("password", "");
const [email, setEmail, handleEmail] = useInput("email", "");</code></pre>

          <p>Although this isn't something you will often do (storing input values in localStorage), this setup is quite
            powerful, and it effectively demonstrates how composable hooks can be; by combining the stateful logic of
            multiple custom hooks, you can compose a really nice custom hook with advanced stateful logic.</p>

          <p>One final thing to note is that we can employ the useLocalStorage custom hook in other places now as well.
            So, not only do we have an extra-powerful useInput created by composing multiple hooks together, we also
            have another custom hook available to us anytime we want to persist data in localStorage.</p>
