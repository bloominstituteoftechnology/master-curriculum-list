                profile and opens doors to new opportunities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Getting Started with LinkedIn</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>LinkedIn is a great way to build your professional network and showcase your experience. Throughout this
                section we will be focusing on the basics of getting your profile set up. These steps are important and
                impact your profile showing up in recruiter searchers! First up, you want to start by making sure your
                personal information is correct and clear.</p>

            <p>To edit your profile, click on the "pencil" icon on the right hand side. From there, you want to fill in
                several things:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>First Name</li>
                <li>Last Name</li>
                <li>Additional Name (This is for a nickname or alternative name that you would like to go by)</li>
                <li>Pronouns (If you'd like to have that information listed)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Headline</h3>
            <p>The key area to update in this space is your headline. Here, you want to customize your headline to list
                job titles you are targeting. If you are in Full stack web, you want to list 'Web Developer' first,
                followed by your focus area of either 'Frontend Software Engineer' or 'Backend Software Engineer.'</p>

            <p>Then, you want to add a few key tools that you have been working with recently. For example, 'JavaScript'
                'React' 'Python' 'Java'</p>

            <p>Customizing this headline section will help your profile be discovered by recruiters using the search
                algorithm, which can generate more connections and possible job opportunities.</p>

            <p>In addition, be sure to scroll down and select an Industry from the drop down. 'Software Development' is
                a common choice.</p>

            <p>Note: Do not add the 'position' or 'education' fields at this point. We will get to that later on.</p>

            <p>Lastly, be sure to fill in your location with your country/region.</p>

            <p>And of course, select 'Save' to save all your changes.</p>

            <h3>Updating the Profile Photo</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the camera icon located in the center of the photo area</li>
                <li>Choose 'upload photo'</li>
                <li>Select a photo where you are clearly viewed</li>
                <li>Change the editing to zoom in or change the filter color</li>
                <li>Select 'Save'</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Banner</h3>
            <p>LinkedIn states that each section that is customized helps boost the strength of the overall profile. For
                the banner, it's recommended to select something that is industry related and professional as this is a
                professional platform.</p>

            <p>You can create a custom banner image using free tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash</a>: Free images
                    and photos you can download and use to create a custom banner.</li>
                <li><a href="https://canva.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canva</a>: A free graphic
                    design tool with various templates and tools for creating banners and other graphics.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe
                        Express</a>: Another free graphic design tool that allows you to create banners and other visual
                    content.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While LinkedIn does provide some banner options, it's recommended that you use your own customer banner.
                Once you find a banner image that you like, you are going to select upload, choose that banner, then
                apply to save the banner in place.</p>

            <h3>Profile URL</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Click 'Edit public profile & URL' on the right hand side of the page.</li>
                <li>Click the edit pencil icon under 'personalize the URL' on the right hand side of the page.</li>
                <li>Change the default URL to your name or a handle you use on other public platforms.</li>
                <li>Click 'save'</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Open to Work</h3>
            <p>The open to work feature indicates to recruiters your job preferences and helps your profile to show up
                in designated recruiter searches.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Click on the edit pencil icon in the 'open to work' feature.</li>
                <li>Click 'add titles' under job titles.</li>
                <li>Add variations of the job that you are looking for, adding up to at least five total.</li>
                <li>Select your workplace environment preferences.</li>
                <li>Make sure your start date availability is 'immediately'</li>
                <li>Under job type, make sure you have selected 'all available'</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The final feature in this box is to add the 'Open to Work' visual tag to appear over your photo.This
                indicates that you are actively searching for a job. However, there is an option to show this to
                recruiters only. Play around with this feature - see how engagement goes when the tag is visible versus
                not visible.</p>

            <p>Make sure to save all your changes!</p>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Pull up your LinkedIn Profile and begin to update each of the sections:</p>

                <li>Profile Photo</li>
                <li>Banner</li>
                <li>Profile URL</li>
                <li>Open to Work</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once updated be sure to save!</p>

            <h2>Adding LinkedIn profile section content</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Now that you've set up the basics of your profile it's time to get into the major content that can really
                help your profile stand out! Start off by clicking the 'Add profile section' button found under your
                profile photo. From there, you'll see a pop up of three options. Go ahead and select 'Core'.</p>

            <h3>Core</h3>
            <p>We're going to fill in this entire section, so start at the top with the 'About me' and add something
                short and sweet. You want to avoid really long paragraphs because no one is going to read two or three
                paragraphs in this area.</p>

            <p>Adding something that is eye-catching here and not too long, with enough valuable information is the key
                to grabbing and keeping the attention of the viewer.</p>

            <p>Things to include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Job Title (ie. Full Stack Engineer)</li>
                <li>What are you passionate about? (ie. creating web applications)</li>
                <li>Overview of background</li>
                <li>Direct the view to what they should look at next (ie. check out my recent posts or recent project
                    highlights posted below)</li>
                <li>Current Tech Stacks and/or tools</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>Under your 'About me' you will see a new section with a button that says 'Add Skills' Here, you will want
                to indicate your top five skills that you want associated with your profile.</p>

            <p>Be sure to hit 'Save' once you are done and review the information added to your profile.</p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Click on 'Add profile section' again and get started under the next area: Add Education</p>

            <p>Fill out the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>School → BloomTech</li>
                <li>Degree → Your program (Full Stack Web, Backend Development, Data Science)</li>
                <li>Start → Year</li>
                <li>Description → Program description (can find on BloomTech Website)</li>
                <li>Skills → Top five skills</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Be sure to do this step for any and all degrees that you hold.</p>

            <p class="note">Note: Once you hit 'save' on this section, LinkedIn will ask if you want to share this news
                with your network. For now, click no or skip because you don't want to alert people of every little
                update.</p>

            <h3>Career Experience</h3>
            <p>Once again, click into the 'add profile section' under your profile photo, then select 'add position'</p>

            <p>This is where you will add all previous professional positions, starting with the most recent.</p>

            <p>If you have taken a career break, it's best practice to make your recent position 'Freelance Web
                Developer' as this will help with recruiters viewing your profile.</p>

            <p>Fill out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Title</li>
                <li>Employment Type</li>
                <li>Company name (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Start Date</li>
                <li>End Date (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Industry</li>
                <li>Description (Be sure to include a few key bullet points that details tools you've been using, and
                    things you've been participating in.)</li>
                <li>Skills</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Click 'save' and then go back to repeat these steps for each previous role.</p>

            <h3>Skills (again)</h3>
            <p>Yes, you've already added the top five skills in multiple places in this section but now we can add more.
            </p>

            <p>Once again, click into the 'add profile section' under your profile photo, then select 'add skills'</p>

            <p>This is where we maximize the amount of skills associated with your profile. The reason we do this is
                because recruiters use LinkedIn to search for candidates by skills and previous positions or titles. By
                maximizing the amount of skills in your profile, we are maximizing the amount of chances the recruiter
                can find you in a search.</p>

            <p class="note">Note: The max in this section is fifty skills. Be sure to include all fifty.</p>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Pull up your LinkedIn Profile and begin to update each of the sections:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Core</li>
                <li>Skills</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Career Experience</li>
                <li>Skills (again)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once updated be sure to save!</p>

                are your experience at this point in your career so highlighting them and making it easy for employers
                to access is extremely important.</p>

            <h3>Adding a Project Section</h3>
            <p>Rounding out your LinkedIn profile, it's important to highlight your technical skills by showing off the
                projects you've created.</p>

            <p>Start off by clicking:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add profile section</li>
                <li>Additional</li>
            </ol>
            <p>From there, click on 'add projects'</p>

            <p>The pop-up box will appear with the information for you to fill out, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project name</li>
                <li>Start Date</li>
                <li>End Date</li>
                <li>Associated with (dropdown)</li>
                <li>Project URL (Github URL or deployed site URL)</li>
                <li>Description (pull bullet points from your resume)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: Projects can come from the sprint challenges, or any tasks in which you have worked on key elements
                within a web application or a specific project. Side projects done throughout the program should also be
                included.</p>

            <p>Once you've completed filling in the information, click on 'save' and scan your profile to confirm the
                section is there.</p>

            <p>Repeat as needed for all your projects.</p>

            <h3>Additional Content Section</h3>
            <p>Spend a moment scanning the options under the additional section to see if there's anything else you'd
                like to add to your profile. For example, if you speak additional languages, received honors & awards,
                or volunteer with an organization.</p>

            <h3>Your Completed Profile</h3>
            <p>Congrats! You've completed your LinkedIn profile.</p>

            <p>Take a minute to look over your profile and make sure you have customized the following:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Job preferences</li>
                <li>Short & sweet 'About Me'</li>
                <li>Top skills</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Pull up your LinkedIn Profile and begin to update each of the sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Projects</li>
                <li>Any other sections relevant to your experience</li>
            </ul>
