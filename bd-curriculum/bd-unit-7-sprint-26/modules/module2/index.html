                <p>The Callable interface represents a task that returns a result and can throw an exception. This makes
                    it more powerful than Runnable, which cannot return a value or throw checked exceptions.</p>
                <p>Key differences between Callable and Runnable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Callable can return results while Runnable cannot</li>
                    <li>Callable can throw checked exceptions while Runnable cannot</li>
                    <li>Callable is more suitable for tasks that compute values</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code>// Implementing Callable using lambda syntax
Callable&lt;String&gt; task = () -> {
    // Some computation that returns a value
    return "Task completed successfully";
};

// Submitting a Callable to an ExecutorService
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
Future&lt;String&gt; future = executor.submit(task);</code></pre>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In this lesson, we will learn about two new concurrency tools, the Callable and Future interfaces. We
                    will use them to execute tasks with return values in concurrent threads and get those values after
                    those threads have completed. We will learn how to use them with an ExecutorService from the
                    previous lesson.</p>

                <p>The first reading focuses on using Callables for concurrent programming. We'll be explaining the
                    difference between a Callable and a Runnable, and how to use them with an ExecutorService.</p>
                <p>The second reading will focus on Futures. We'll explain how they wrap the results of concurrent tasks
                    and how to safely use them.</p>

                <h2>The Callable Interface</h2>
                <p>Up until now we've been using the Runnable interface in our concurrency lessons. Runnables, when used
                    in threading, allow us to execute code concurrently to our application's main thread. They can be
                    executed by instantiating a Thread with them directly or, as we learned in the last lesson,
                    submitted to an ExecutorService. However, Runnables don't have return values, so threads executing a
                    Runnable can't return a value upon completion. That's where the Callable interface comes in.</p>

                <p>The Callable interface is conceptually the same as Runnable. They both can be used to execute tasks
                    in a concurrent thread. The major difference is that Callables return a value on completion. The
                    return type is defined in the class declaration where we implement Callable, like this ...implements
                    Callable&lt;ReturnType&gt;. The Callable interface has a method named call() which contains the code
                    to be executed by the thread. This is similar to the run() method in the Runnable interface. The
                    call() method does two things different from run(). It can return a value of the type defined in our
                    declaration and it can throw checked exceptions, neither of which are possible with a Runnable.</p>

                <p>One of the limitations of Callables is that we can't use them to instantiate a Thread the way we did
                    with Runnable. However, we can still use them with ExecutorService. When we submit() a Callable to
                    an ExecutorService, the ExecutorService wraps the result of call() in a Future. Futures provide a
                    way to access the return value of a thread that may not have completed yet. We will learn more about
                    Futures in the next reading.</p>

                <p>Combining Callables with an ExecutorService allows us to execute many tasks at once and to combine
                    their results easily without having to share states between threads like we have done with
                    Runnables.</p>

                <h2>How to Use Callables</h2>
                <p>In the code below, we have a program that is simulating charging a credit card. We have a class
                    CardVerification that implements Callable and returns a Boolean. The call() method checks that the
                    card number passed in starts with a specific sequence, and returns if it was verified or not. In the
                    CardChargerManager class, we pass in cardNum to CardVerification and submit it to an
                    ExecutorService. Then the result of the call is printed.</p>

                <pre><code>public class CardVerification implements Callable&lt;Boolean&gt; {
    private String cardNum;
    
    /**
    * Constructor for CardVerification.
    * @param num The card number to verify.
    */
    public CardVerification(String num) {
        cardNum = num;
    }

    /**
    * Method call() is called on execution.
    * @return Returns a boolean on completion.
    */
    public Boolean call() {
        System.out.println("CardVerification called.");
        return cardNum.substring(0, 4).equals("1234");
    }

}
public class CardChargerManager {
    private String cardNum = "1234-5678-8910";

    /**
    * Method called when a credit card is charged.
    */
    public void chargeCard() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService verificationExecutor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        CardVerification verify = new CardVerification(cardNum);

        Future&lt;Boolean&gt; cardNumValid = verificationExecutor.submit(verify);
        System.out.println("cardNum verification result: " + cardNumValid.get());
    }

}</code></pre>

                <p>Output:</p>

                <pre><code>CardVerification called.
cardNum verification result: true</code></pre>

                <p>This might seem like a lot, so let's go through it piece by piece. First, we implement Callable in
                    CardVerification. It has a similar structure to Runnable, with some small changes. The first
                    difference is in the declaration line.</p>

                <pre><code>public class CardVerification implements Callable&lt;Boolean&gt; {</code></pre>

                <p>For Callable interfaces we need to declare a return type, in this case, a Boolean. Then we implement
                    the call() method that needs to return that same type.</p>

                <pre><code>public Boolean call() {
    System.out.println("CardVerification called.");
    return cardNum.substring(0, 4).equals("1234");
}</code></pre>

                <p>As we've discussed, the call() method serves the same function as run() does for Runnable, the
                    primary difference being that call() has a return value. We should note that both call() and run()
                    don't accept any parameters, so any required values need to be set in a constructor or setters
                    before call() is executed. In this example, cardNum is passed into the constructor. Note that call()
                    can also be called like a regular method directly in your code like run(). But, as you'll remember,
                    that doesn't execute it in a new thread. That's why we need to submit CardVerification to an
                    ExecutorService.</p>

                <p>In the next section, the chargeCard() method is doing a lot of things. We will step through what's
                    happening, but much of the code here we will discuss more in the next reading.</p>

                <pre><code>public void chargeCard() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    ExecutorService verificationExecutor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
    CardVerification verify = new CardVerification(cardNum);

    Future&lt;Boolean&gt; cardNumValid = verificationExecutor.submit(verify);
    System.out.println("cardNum verification result: " + cardNumValid.get());
}</code></pre>

                <p>First, create an ExecutorService to run our task. Then, we create a new CardVerification instance and
                    pass in cardNum. This is our Callable instance we want to run in a new thread. To do that, we call
                    submit() on the ExecutorService, passing in our Callable instance. submit() will wrap the result of
                    the task as a Future of the same type declared by the Callable interface. So, when submit() is
                    called here with our CardVerification class, a Future&lt;Boolean&gt; result is returned and stored
                    in the variable cardNumValid.</p>

                <p>Lastly, we use the result in our output by calling cardNumValid.get(). In order to call get() we need
                    to handle two exceptions: ExecutionException and InterruptedException. In this example we handled
                    them in the method declaration. These can be thrown by Future's get() method, but we'll go more into
                    what can cause them in the next reading.</p>

                <h2>Callable lambdas</h2>
                <p>It should be noted that Callable tasks can also be created as lambdas, like we did with Runnable
                    tasks in the last lesson. In the example below, we took the code above and modified it to
                    demonstrate how this would work.</p>

                <pre><code>public class CardChargerManager {
    private List&lt;String&gt; cardNumbers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList("1234", "5678", "9010"));

    /**
    * Method called when a credit card is charged.
    */
    public void chargeCards() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService verificationExecutor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        List&lt;Future&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt; cardValidations = new ArrayList&lt;Future&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt;();

        for (String cardNumber : cardNumbers) {
            cardValidations.add(
                verificationExecutor.submit(() -> cardNumber.substring(0,4).equals("1234")));
        }

        for (Future&lt;Boolean&gt; isValid : cardValidations) {
            if (!isValid.get()) {
                //Bad Request.
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

                <p>In this modification of the CardChargeManager class we have an ArrayList of cardNumbers that we will
                    be validating. The purpose of ExecutorService is to allow us to create many threads very quickly to
                    handle many concurrent tasks, so we'll be creating a new Callable for each card number in our
                    ArrayList.</p>

                <p>Now, when the chargeCards() method is called, it iterates through our list of card numbers and
                    creates a new callable lambda for each one. That lambda call returns its Future&lt;Boolean&gt; right
                    into a new ArrayList of cardValidations that correspond to whether the card number is valid or not.
                    You can see that the lambda function contains the same validation code that our Callable
                    CardVerification class had. In this case it's only a few lines long rather than an entire separate
                    class! Once all the threads are created, we loop through the cardValidations list to see if any of
                    the cards were invalid. If they were, we'd respond appropriately here, probably by throwing an
                    exception that indicates a bad request was made.</p>

                <p>You should note that since we're creating the lambda as part of the CardChargerManager class, we are
                    able to use cardNumbers as a shared value. Since we are not making changes to cardNumbers, this is
                    OK. If we were making changes, we would need to be more careful, and would probably want to give
                    each thread their own copy of the value they were validating, which would be better suited to our
                    previous example with a separately implemented class.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>In this reading, we learned about the Callable interface. We learned the differences between Runnable
                    and Callable. We also learned how the call() method returns a result on completion and can throw
                    checked exceptions. We also learned how to use ExecutorService's submit() method to execute a
                    Callable in a separate thread and store the result in a Future. We were able to not only execute
                    Callable tasks in a separate thread, but also retrieve the results of them this way.</p>

                <h2>Up Next</h2>
                <p>In the next reading, we will be covering the Future we get when we submit a Callable to an
                    ExecutorService. We'll learn how to retrieve the result of the Callable from the Future and how to
                    handle exceptions that can occur while retrieving that result.</p>

                <p>A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It provides methods to check if the
                    computation is complete, wait for its completion, and retrieve the computation result.</p>
                <p>When working with Future objects, remember:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Future doesn't immediately contain the result</li>
                    <li>Calling get() will block until the result is available</li>
                    <li>You can use isDone() to check if a task is complete without blocking</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code>// Retrieving results from a Future with exception handling
Future&lt;String&gt; future = executor.submit(task);

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In this lesson, we will learn about two new concurrency tools, the Callable and Future interfaces. We
                    will use them to execute tasks with return values in concurrent threads and get those values after
                    those threads have completed. We will learn how to use them with an ExecutorService from the
                    previous lesson.</p>

                <p>The first reading focused on using Callables for concurrent programming. We explained the difference
                    between Callable and Runnable, and how to use Callables with an ExecutorService.</p>
                <p>This reading will focus on the Futures. We'll explain how they wrap the results of concurrent tasks,
                    and how to safely use them.</p>

                <h2>The Future interface</h2>
                <p>In the previous reading, we learned about the Callable interface and how we use it to submit tasks to
                    an ExecutorService in order to get a result from a concurrent thread. Now we want to dig deeper into
                    how those results are returned wrapped in a Future. The Future object is not a direct value, it just
                    represents the "future" result of a concurrent task. This means that when the object is created and
                    has a task assigned to it, there isn't immediately a result in it. Only after the task is complete
                    are we able to retrieve the result from the Future.</p>

                <p>This behavior makes working with Futures a little tricky. Future has a method get() which is how we
                    get the result of the task. Complications can come up when calling get(). On creation, a Future will
                    not have a value we can access. At this point it is only representative of the result since the
                    associated task will not have completed. Meaning if we tried to call get() on a Future immediately
                    after we create it, it's likely the result won't yet exist, so our main thread will be blocked. The
                    get() method, when called, will stop (or "block") the execution of the main thread until the result
                    referenced by a Future is available. We'll be looking at how to retrieve a result using get() in the
                    next section.</p>

                <p>It's important to understand, especially now with Future, that we are dealing with concurrent
                    execution. When we submit or implement code in a concurrent thread, we largely lose control over the
                    timing or order of our code's execution. With Future, we have the means to work with values from
                    tasks that may not have completed yet. Many of the examples we've been working with in these lessons
                    are simple enough that they can complete almost immediately. But in practical applications, you may
                    be working with concurrent systems where tasks take longer, and it will be important to take these
                    precautions to maximize the value of concurrency and avoid problems.</p>

                <h2>Using Futures</h2>
                <p>In this code snippet, we are making a simulation of an online cart checkout. We have two Callable
                    inline lambdas that simulate network calls and return Booleans that confirm if the call was made or
                    not. Both are submitted to the ExecutorService in checkout(), and a message is printed reporting if
                    the transaction was successful.</p>

                <pre><code>public class CartCheckout {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;
    private final DistroService distroService;
    private final AmazonUser user;
    public CartCheckout(AmazonUser user, PaymentService paymentService, DistroService distroService) {
        this.user = user;
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
        this.distroService = distroService;
    }

    /**
    * Called when user goes to complete checkout for an order.
    * @return Boolean whether all checkout tasks completed successfully
    * @throws ExecutionException if calling get() throws an exception.
    * @throws InterruptedException if this thread was interrupted while waiting.
    */
    public Boolean checkout() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService cartExecutor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        List&lt;Future&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt; networkCallResults = new ArrayList&lt;Future&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt;();

        networkCallResults.add(
            cartExecutor.submit(() -> paymentService.cardApproved(user.cardNum)));
        networkCallResults.add(
            cartExecutor.submit(() -> distroService.newOrderSubmitted(user.address)));

        cartExecutor.shutdown();
        boolean checkoutSuccessful = true;
        for (Future&lt;Boolean&gt; result : networkCallResults) {
            if (!result.get()) {
                checkoutSuccessful = false;
            }
        }

        return checkoutSuccessful;
    }

}</code></pre>

                <p>To start, our CartCheckout class constructor accepts our dependencies, setting the AmazonUser,
                    PaymentService and DistroService we need for our checkout process. These will be used by our
                    Callable lambdas to handle parts of the checkout process concurrently. We've declared them final in
                    order to ensure that the objects they reference won't change while threads are using them.</p>

                <p>In the checkout() method, we create an ExecutorService and submit() the two Callable lambda tasks,
                    storing the returned Futures in list networkCallResults.</p>

                <pre><code>List&lt;Future&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt; networkCallResults = new ArrayList&lt;Future&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt;();

networkCallResults.add(
    cartExecutor.submit(() -> paymentService.cardApproved(user.cardNum)));
networkCallResults.add(
    cartExecutor.submit(() -> distroService.newOrderSubmitted(user.address)));</code></pre>

                <p>Once we have our tasks submitted and our list of results in the networkCallResults list, we can call
                    shutdown() on the ExecutorService since we don't require it anymore. We then get() the result of
                    each of the Futures in our list to confirm each checkout task completed successfully, then return
                    that result. Let's look more closely at the loop where we check the results in our Futures.</p>

                <pre><code>boolean checkoutSuccessful = true;
for (Future&lt;Boolean&gt; result : networkCallResults) {
    if (!result.get()) {
       checkoutSuccessful = false;
    }
}</code></pre>

                <p>The important code is the result.get() call. When using Futures, it is a best practice to submit our
                    tasks as early as possible and retrieve their results as late as possible. This minimizes the time
                    we block on the get() method waiting for those tasks to complete. Here we shut down the
                    ExecutorService before starting the check loop, which buys us some time for the tasks to complete.
                    In a real-world example, the network calls might take longer than the time we give them here. This
                    would result in our code being blocked until all the results came back.</p>

                <h2>Using exceptions with Future</h2>
                <p>The get() method in the example above can throw two exceptions, InterrruptedException and
                    ExecutionException. An InterruptedException can be thrown if the thread calling get() is interrupted
                    while waiting for get() to return. An ExecutionException wraps any exceptions thrown while the
                    Callable is executing. Depending on what your program is doing you may need to handle these in
                    specific ways so you can recover from them gracefully. In the code snippet below we added a
                    try/catch to the check loop from the example above. We log the error, mark that checkout was not
                    successful, and then continue the execution of our program.</p>

                <pre><code>boolean checkoutSuccessful = true;
for (Future&lt;Boolean&gt; result : networkCallResults) {
    try {
        if (!result.get()) {
            checkoutSuccessful = false;
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        checkoutSuccessful = false;
    }
}</code></pre>

                <h2>get() Timeouts</h2>
                <p>There are other methods in Future that are worth knowing. One example is the get() method has an
                    overload for adding a time limit on retrieving results. This overload takes the timeout duration and
                    a time unit and throws a TimeoutException if the task has not returned a value before the timeout
                    duration expires. This is useful when you want to set a limit on how long your main thread can block
                    while waiting for your other tasks to complete. The example below shows how to use this, including
                    the exception.</p>

                <pre><code>boolean checkoutSuccessful = true;
for (Future&lt;Boolean&gt; result : networkCallResults) {
    try {
        if (!result.get(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
            checkoutSuccessful = false;
        }
    } catch (TimeoutException e) {
        System.out.println("Network call timed out!");
        checkoutSuccessful = false;
    }
}</code></pre>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In this lesson, we covered the Callable and Future interfaces. We learned how Futures wrap the
                    results of Callable tasks submitted to an ExecutorService, and how we can properly access those
                    values with minimal interruption. These functions allow us to be a lot more efficient with our
                    concurrent programming. We can use Callable tasks to return values back to our main thread from
                    concurrent threads, spreading out the computation of large tasks and combining the results at the
                    end. The Future objects created by the ExecutorService allow us to store and pass along the results
                    of our concurrent tasks even before they've completed. This gives us the flexibility to let a
                    concurrent task run its course while continuing with the processing in our main thread. When we need
                    it, the Future will either have the value or pause our main thread until the value is ready. By
                    submitting tasks early and retrieving the results after our other computations are complete, we can
                    maximize our processing with many threads and minimize the time we spend waiting for those threads
                    to complete.</p>

                <h3>Advanced Future Features</h3>
                <p>Futures provide several additional capabilities that help you control asynchronous task execution,
                    such as timeouts, cancellation, and checking completion status.</p>
                <p>Important Future methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)</code> - Wait for result with a timeout</li>
                    <li><code>cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)</code> - Attempt to cancel execution</li>
                    <li><code>isCancelled()</code> - Check if task was cancelled</li>
                    <li><code>isDone()</code> - Check if task completed (successfully, with exception, or cancelled)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code>// Using Future with timeout
Future&lt;String&gt; future = executor.submit(task);
try {
    // Wait only 2 seconds for the result
    String result = future.get(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (TimeoutException e) {
    // Task took too long, cancel it
    future.cancel(true);
    System.out.println("Task timed out and was cancelled");
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle other exceptions
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    executor.shutdown();
}</code></pre>
