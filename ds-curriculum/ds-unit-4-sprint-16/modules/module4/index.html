                    profile, ensuring they complement each other and effectively communicate your skills, projects, and
                    professional value to potential employers in the data science field.</p>

                <h3>Resume Heading</h3>
                <p>Your heading contains incredibly important information for a future employer. If they don't know how
                    to contact you - they can't move you into an interview process. Here is the information that should
                    be displayed in your heading:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First name (use the name you prefer to be called)</li>

                <h3>Technical Skills Section</h3>
                <p>A technical skills section on your resume allows for a reader to quickly scan your tech stack and
                    gain a high-level understanding of what you have experience with. It's also an easy way for ATS
                    systems to catch key technical skills they may be filtering for.</p>
                <p>Add the skills you've learned up to this point at BloomTech:</p>
                <p><strong>Front End: </strong>React.js, Redux, Hooks, Context API, Jest, Cypress, Yup, Axios,
                    JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>
                <p><strong>Back End: </strong>Node.js, Express, SQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Python, Git CLI, GitHub, VS
                    Code, Vercel, Heroku</p>
                <p><strong>Additional: </strong>Agile Project Management, Algorithms, Architecture, Debugging,
                    Deployment</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Projects Section</h3>
                <p>The projects section of your resume is a crucial component that allows you to showcase your practical
                    skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities to potential employers. As a current learner and
                    soon to be recent graduate, highlighting relevant projects can significantly enhance your resume and
                    make you stand out from the competition.</p>

                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select relevant projects</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Academic Projects:</strong> Throughout the entire BloomTech program you will be
                        completing Guided Projects, Sprint Challenges, etc. These are all projects that can go on your
                        resume!</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Projects:</strong> Side projects are invaluable complements to what you are
                        already doing here at BloomTech. They provide hands-on experience, reinforce learning, and allow
                        you to explore your interests beyond the curriculum's scope.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Format your projects</p>
                <p>Include essential details such as project title, description, your role, technologies used, and
                    outcomes achieved. You will need to include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Title of the project</li>
                    <li>Your role on the project</li>
                    <li>The tech stack you used</li>
                    <li>2-4 bullet points to highlight key accomplishments and contributions</li>
                    <li>Link to the GitHub repo</li>
                    <li>Optional: Link to the website if it's deployed</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Write your bullet points</p>
                <p>Project bullet points need to indicate your direct actions and highlight examples of your hands-on
                    dev work to validate and showcase your knowledge, skills, and abilities thus far.</p>

            <h2>LinkedIn & Resume Integration</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Aligning LinkedIn and Resume Content</h3>
                <p>Your LinkedIn profile and resume should tell the same story, but they don't need to be identical.
                    LinkedIn offers more space to expand on your experiences, skills, and achievements, while your
                    resume needs to be concise and targeted.</p>

                <h4>Key Integration Points:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consistent Branding:</strong> Use the same professional headshot, headline/title, and
                        summary/objective across both platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skills Alignment:</strong> Ensure the skills listed on your resume match your LinkedIn
                        skills section, prioritizing those most relevant to your target roles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Showcase:</strong> Feature the same key projects on both platforms, but LinkedIn
                        allows for more detailed descriptions and media attachments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Experience Details:</strong> Keep employment dates, company names, and job titles
                        consistent between resume and LinkedIn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education Verification:</strong> Make sure educational credentials are identical on both
                        platforms to avoid discrepancies during background checks.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Remember to use your resume as a targeted document you can customize for each application, while your
                    LinkedIn serves as your comprehensive professional profile that showcases the full breadth of your
                    experience and skills.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Check that your LinkedIn profile includes all the same information as your resume, plus any
                        additional details or media that enhance your profile</li>
                    <li>Ensure consistency in how you present yourself across both platforms</li>
