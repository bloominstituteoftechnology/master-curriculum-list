                <h2>Job Outreach Strategies</h2>
                <p>Learn effective strategies for reaching out to potential employers and building your professional network.</p>

                <h3>Goal: Outreach to 5 Jobs</h3>
                <p>Draft and send 5 cold emails, tracking your outreach in Job Tracker.</p>

                <h3>Finding Contacts to Reach Out To</h3>
                <p><strong><i>The goal of outreach is to make contact with your future employer.</i></strong></p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>In your outreach, you want to get as close as possible to your future team. Here's how to prioritize people at the company you're applying to, and what tools to use.</p>

                <h4>! Who to prioritize in your outreach !</h4>
                
                <h5>#1 Your Future Boss</h5>
                <p>Your top priority in your outreach is to find your future boss. Titles to look out for include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engineering Manager</li>
                    <li>Data or UX Team Lead</li>
                    <li>Head of Engineering, Head of Data, Head of Design</li>
                    <li>Technical Team Lead</li>
                    <li>VP of Engineering</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>#2 Your Future Peer</h5>
                <p>If you can't find your future boss, your second priority is to reach out to a future peer. Someone at the company who holds the same title as the one you are applying to. ‚≠êÔ∏è Bonus points if they have a non-traditional pathway into tech or similar background to you! ‚≠êÔ∏è</p>

                <h5>#3 a Non-Technical HR or People Team Member</h5>
                <p>If you can't find either of the above, at the very least contact a technical recruiter or member of the People/HR team. These people are great to contact in addition to the list above, but shouldn't be the only people you contact unless you absolutely can't find anyone technical to reach out to.</p>

                    <li>LinkedIn's in-site search tools</li>
                    <li>This Google search term to "Xray scan" LinkedIn: site:www.linkedin.com/in "company name" "role" "additional keywords, i.e city"</li>
                    <li>Lambda Job Tracker</li>

                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    <h4>‚è± Give yourself time to find the right contacts: up to 10 minutes per job</h4>
                    <p>Finding the right people to contact is the most manual part of the application process but also the most important. The more time you give yourself to find the right person, the more likely you are to be flagged in the ATS (Applicant Tracking System).</p>
                    
                    <p>Reserve at least 10 minutes per job to find the right people to outreach to. This will get faster as you practice, but make sure you block out enough time to find the right people to contact.</p>

                    <h4>üìß Send 5 cold emails</h4>
                    <p>Now that you're a Master of Outreach‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, send 5 cold emails using the techniques we've covered. Just do it!</p>

                    <p>When you've sent 5 cold emails and tracked your outreach in Job Tracker, your progress will be reflected here. It may take some time for the assignment to update.</p>

                <h2>Apply to 5 Jobs</h2>

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p><strong><i>Apply to 5 jobs</i></strong> and track them in Job Tracker</p>

                <h3>Submitting Quality Applications</h3>
                <p>Job searching is tiring! Especially when you don't hear back from companies.</p>

                <p>Some job seekers take a quantity approach to their search, submitting applications through "one-click" or "easy apply"- you upload your resume and call it a day. The act of clicking submit might feel productive in the moment, but days or weeks later this approach doesn't often produce the desired result - an invitation to an interview. You might as well call this approach the application or resume black hole.</p>

                <p><strong>If you want a higher response rate on applications you need to:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Submit a quality application, then‚Ä¶</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Follow-up on that application by reaching out to a human</strong></li>
                </ol>

                <h4>What makes an application a quality application?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Apply to a posting that has been live within the past 2 weeks.</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Apply directly through a company's website.</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Have 50% (or more) of the requirements or preferred qualifications.</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Use a strong and relevant resume to apply.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>

                <h3>Following Up on Quality Applications</h3>
                <p>Now that you know how to submit quality applications, time to deep dive into app follow-up. When you submit an app your work isn't over!</p>

                <p>You need to try to get your app seen by a human so it doesn't languish <a href="https://www.jobscan.co/blog/lever-ats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the ATS</a>.</p>

                <h4>‚û°Ô∏è Fast facts about follow-up:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow-up means contacting a person who works at the company you are applying to. You might hear the Careers Team refer to this as "outreach" or "cold contacting" as well.</li>
                    <li>Lambda grads get the best results from follow-up emails. But you can also connect with someone via a LinkedIn connection request + with an attached note, a LinkedIn InMail message, a Twitter DM, etc.</li>
                    <li>Your top priority when you outreach is to your "future boss" or the technical stakeholder for the role. If you can't find this person, find a "future peer" or someone who holds the same title as you on the team. Bonus points if they have a similar pathway into tech.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The most important thing is that you make contact with an actual person involved with hiring for the role you're applying for. Don't skip this step - outreach is unavoidable in a successful job search!</p>

                <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/4644e8b9678d44baa796c68c83acd4e6" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen title="Following Up on Applications"></iframe>
                </div>

                <h4>üö´ The ATS is, sadly, not your friend.</h4>
                <p>To understand why we outreach, it's useful to understand exactly how an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) works. When you apply to a role, your app lands in a database of many other names. Because no one has time to review every single app submitted for a job <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/you-only-get-6-seconds-of-fame-make-it-count" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(not even for the proverbial 7.4 seconds)</a> the hiring team needs to use the ATS to cut the list to a manageable size.</p>

                <p>Teams can filter on things like years of experience, location, or things that were listed as "nice to haves" in the description. It actually doesn't really matter what a hiring team filters on, because you simply can't customize your resume for every filter out there.</p>

                <h4>üìß Outreach is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Instead of customizing your resume for every possible filter a hiring team might use, it's more efficient to use outreach to get yourself on the hiring team's radar. Don't wait for an ATS to surface you, your outreach increases the chance someone will pull up your app.</p>

                <p>No matter where you are in the ATS, filtered out or not, they can search for your app. Outreach is an important tool to advocate for yourself in the hiring process. Get around the ATS, and do your best to ensure that the time you spent on your quality application doesn't go to waste.</p>

                <h4>ü§î What about my quality application?</h4>
                <p>You might be thinking ‚Äî hold on. I spent time on my application, submitted it through the company site, applied within 24 hours of the role being posted, I'm a 50% match for what they are asking for.</p>

                <p>Won't the team know my name by those steps alone?</p>

                <p>...maybe. Sometimes you'll get invited to interviews without outreach, especially when you're among the first to apply. But in your job search, you want to operate on more than maybes! Outreach increases the potential for someone to see your quality application.</p>

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>Apply to 5 jobs, tracking their status in Job Tracker. Use our criteria for quality:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è You meet at least half (50%) of the qualifications</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Job posting is less than 2 weeks old</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Applying directly to the company using their website</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Use a resume that emphasizes keywords and skills needed for the job</li>
                </ul>

                <p>On the next page, you'll move on to implement the most critical step: sending an outreach note to a talent or technical professional at each company.</p>

                <h2>Career Readiness in Labs</h2>
                <p>In this module, we'll walk through the process you'll follow in Labs to get your resume, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub profile fully career-ready by incorporating your Labs project. You'll also ensure your Learner Profile is up to date!</p>

                <p>Just like in Applied CS, you'll submit your Career Artifacts as part of this module. You'll prepare by reviewing the resources in this module and preparing your project information. Your Resume Reviewer will evaluate them and provide feedback as necessary.</p>

                <p>If one or more of them still needs work, you'll get targeted feedback on how to improve them, and you'll be able to resubmit them once you've made the required revisions.</p>

                <p>At that point, you'll also have the option to schedule a live, one-on-one review session. This session builds on the work you put in last unit‚Äîyour Resume Reviewer will work with you to incorporate your Labs project and finalize your artifacts before graduation.</p>

                <p>Regardless, though, if all your artifacts still aren't passing after two submissions, you'll be required to schedule a review session.</p>

                <h3>Launching Your Job Search</h3>
                <p>Since Labs is also officially the start of your job search, you'll find plenty of resources and instructions in the Job Search course in Canvas‚Äîbut for our purposes here, you'll need to source, apply to, and conduct outreach to at least five jobs to pass this course!</p>

                <p>We've done our fair share of homework here (trust us on this!), and we've refined everything we've learned about what works into a template that optimizes for getting across the critical information hiring managers are looking for, fast.</p>

                <h3>Setting Up Your GitHub Profile</h3>
                <p>Note: If you attended and passed Applied CS, your GitHub profile hopefully already reflects these instructions. If not, please ensure it does before submitting it!</p>

                <p>During your job search, you'll find that many applications ask you to link to your GitHub profile. Use GitHub as a tool to promote yourself and represent your skills. Make it as easy as possible for your prospective employer to imagine you as a contributing member of their team by showcasing your contributions to projects in an organized, compelling way.</p>

                <p>Go through these initial steps to start leveling up your profile.</p>

                <h3>Profile Photo and Name</h3>

                        <li>Profile photo is a clear headshot, bitmoji, or avatar of myself, not the GitHub logo.</li>
                        <li>Name and username displayed is professional and contains a variation of my name.</li>
                        <li>Other relevant profiles like Portfolio or Twitter are linked in my bio.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Profile README</h3>
                <p>GitHub now features a profile README section that is customizable. This section will appear above your pinned projects, giving you the opportunity to do some branding and marketing about yourself. Check out the first 4 minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1z7_GfEPiE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video.</a></p>

                <p>Include the following information in your README:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Introductory message that welcomes viewers to your page</li>
                    <li>2-3 quick bullets or sentences that describe yourself: this can include passions, interests, expertise, and what you currently do</li>
                    <li>Reference skills and expertise you have</li>
                    <li>Contact information to let others know how they can send you a message</li>

                <h3>The GitHub Checklist</h3>
                <p>Take a 5-minute break. Go out and walk your pet iguana. Or just pause to imagine* yourself on a beach with fine white sand, the waves slowly rolling in, as you recline on a fine chaise, your hand hanging off the edge holding an offer letter, and thinking to yourself: Wow‚ÄîI'm sure glad I followed that GitHub Checklist.</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        <p>"After completing Labs, I spent two weeks improving my GitHub profile and creating a portfolio website that showcased my Labs project. I wrote detailed READMEs for all my repositories and started a technical blog where I explained the challenges I faced in Labs and how I solved them.</p>
                        <p>A recruiter found me through one of my blog posts and reached out about a backend developer position. During the interview, they mentioned that my detailed project documentation and technical writing skills set me apart from other candidates. I received an offer three weeks after my initial application!"</p>
