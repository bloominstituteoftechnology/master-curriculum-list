                <h2>Unit 3 Project: Sustainable Packaging</h2>
                <h3>Preliminaries: Been Here, Got the T-Shirt</h3>
                <p>You learned about how our projects are structured and work in the Unit 1 Project.</p>
                <p>The Unit 3 project will be largely the same: we'll still have Project Preparedness Tasks (PPTs) and
                    Project Mastery Tasks (MTs) that we check for completion and correctness with Task Completion Tests
                    (TCTs).</p>
                <p>There will also be a few differences.</p>

                <h3>Welcome to the Cloud</h3>
                <p>In Unit 3 we'll start deploying our code to AWS. We will still develop and run code locally, but our
                    code will also live in the cloud! This means that someone or something, a person or another team's
                    code, can interact with your service. Think about pictures that we have on our phones. When they get
                    added to the cloud, we can share them with other people. Other people can now see or use our photos,
                    but they don't need our phones to do it. This is similar to how teams at Amazon make their services
                    available for customers to use. They put their code in a shared place, and then invite customers to
                    use it.</p>

                <h3>Local Code Coverage Check</h3>
                <p>Just like in last unit, a couple checks will run on your code after it has been pushed and builds
                    into the version set.</p>

                <h3>Ambiguity, Complexity, and Scope.</h3>
                <p>We're notching up the ambiguity in this unit's project. You'll notice that in the mastery tasks we
                    will not be as explicit about the exact implementation details. Remember, we value success as a
                    collaborative effort, so ask and answer questions amongst your peers and in Office Hours (do not
                    make assumptions!). Coincidentally, developers use these same collaborative skills every day, so
                    you'll be getting good practice for when you graduate. Complexity and scope will also be increased
                    in this project, but not hugely so.</p>

                <h2>Unit 3 Project Progress and Tracking</h2>
                <h3>Doneness checklist</h3>
                <p>You're done with this project when you've:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ All Task Completion Tests are passing</li>
                    <li>☐ Code Coverage Check passing</li>
                    <li>☐ Submitted Project Reflection response in Canvas</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Problem: Insisting on the Highest Packaging Standards</h2>
                <p>When customers order items from Amazon, they expect world-class service. That includes being
                    responsible for the future of our planet as we deliver value to each customer. As a new member of
                    the Sustainability team, you will help Amazon make environmentally smart decisions to live up to our
                    customers' expectations.</p>
                <p>Amazon chooses the best packaging option for each order from many available options. The "best"
                    should not be determined by just its packaging cost, but also its environmental impact. For example,
                    sometimes the cheapest packaging option is not the best choice because it ends up in a landfill
                    instead of a recycling center, or because it is not usable for returns. For the sake of this
                    project, we will work with "singles" shipments, shipments that contain a single item.</p>
                <p>When an item is ready for shipment, it is sent to a packaging associate within the fulfillment center
                    (FC) who places the item in its packaging and sends it to the loading bay. These associates work at
                    "packing stations" that include a wide selection of packaging options. The packaging recommendation
                    system tells the associate which packaging option to use for each order. Packaging options vary by
                    type and by dimension.</p>
                <p>Each packing station has boxes and mailers of different sizes. The difference between a box and a
                    mailer is a difference in type, whereas the difference between a small box and a large box is a
                    difference in dimension. Refer to these typical packing stations to identify the boxes (the straight
                    stacks) and the mailers (the curved bundles).</p>

                <h3>Typical Packing Stations</h3>
                <!-- Placeholder for image: Typical Packing Stations -->
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>Let's take a closer look at some of the packaging types Amazon uses.</h3>

                <h4>Corrugate Box</h4>
                <!-- Placeholder for image: Some Corrugate Boxes -->
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Typically just called a "box," this is the most common type of packaging. You probably recognize the
                    big Amazon smile logo. They are relatively heavy compared to other packaging types. Some
                    municipalities will recycle them, but the up front material cost tends to be relatively high, and
                    the quality of the cardboard degrades the more times they are recycled. They are reusable as long as
                    they are not damaged too much.</p>

                <h4>SmartPack</h4>
                <!-- Placeholder for image: A SmartPack -->
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>SmartPacks are bubble mailers that can be recycled via store drop-off. They are harder to reuse than
                    boxes because the seal must be torn off to open the mailer. The bubbles offer some protection for
                    fragile items, but mailers often result in unnecessary packaging for smaller items. (We won't work
                    with these on this project.)</p>

                <h4>Polybag</h4>
                <!-- Placeholder for image: Filled PolyBags on the Conveyor Belt -->
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Smaller and lighter than both boxes and SmartPacks, polybags are made of 80% recycled plastic and are
                    100% recyclable. They are also flexible, allowing a range of item shapes and sizes to be packed
                    easily. Although they can be reused by replacing the tape holding them shut, they do not protect
                    their contents very well. (This project will involve adding polybags as a packaging option to the
                    existing shipment service.)</p>

                <h3>Your task, should you choose to accept it...</h3>
                <p>As it stands, the software architecture of our service allows for a single packaging type with
                    several dimensions. As a member of the Sustainability team, you will extend the packaging
                    recommendation system to make environmentally smarter packaging selections. The packaging software
                    runs in the "Sustainability Technology Systems" part of the fulfillment process shown in this
                    simplified diagram:</p>
                <!-- Placeholder for image: Simplified Fulfillment Process -->
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You will extend the service to support different packaging types after calculating and considering
                    their environmental trade-offs. You will integrate these calculations into the selection process
                    that decides how each item Amazon fulfills is packaged.</p>

                <h2>Technical Design</h2>
                <p>The SustainabilityShipmentService uses one API, PrepareShipment. This API provides the most cost
                    effective way to ship a single item from a specific fulfillment center (FC). The code to support
                    this API is located in the ShipmentService class. It is responsible for providing the shipment
                    recommendation.</p>
                <p>The ShipmentService uses the PackagingDAO to identify all shipping options available in an FC that
                    will fit the item. The ShipmentService then picks the shipment option with the lowest monetary cost
                    and sends a shipping recommendation back to the associate in the FC who is packing the item.</p>
                <p>You will update the service to support different packaging types, and to also consider
                    sustainability, not just monetary cost, when choosing the best shipment option.</p>

                <h2>Project Preparedness Tasks</h2>
                <p>We're taking our first steps in native AWS with this project, so first an overview.</p>
                <p>Thus far, we've written programs that work on our laptops. Java is designed to run on any computer
                    that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so we could copy our code to almost any computer and run it
                    there (this is sometimes called "write once, run anywhere"). Even a computer in an entirely
                    different building could run the program, as long as there was some way to give it input and receive
                    its output. A computer that runs programs without a human directly interacting with it is often
                    called a server.</p>
                <p>Most of our programs aren't all that challenging for a server, though. If we dedicated an entire
                    server to running our program, we'd be wasting a lot of its potential: after all, even our little
                    laptops can run IntelliJ, email, Chime, and a bunch of browser windows at the same time as our
                    programs. An entire server dedicated to something like that would be a huge waste of computer time,
                    electricity, and money.</p>
                <p>Ideally, we'd want a server just powerful enough to run our program. Computers that small are not
                    available, but we could use a larger computer to run a program that emulates many smaller computers
                    at once, effectively converting a large computer into multiple small servers. We can then provide
                    one such small server for each program someone wants to run.</p>
                <p>AWS provides such servers. They're called Elastic Compute Capacity (EC2) instances. But we can be
                    even more frugal.</p>
                <p>Many programs spend most of their time waiting for input. The rest of the time they're just wasting
                    electricity waiting. Ideally, we could reduce power and computer usage by waiting until the service
                    is called by a client, at which point we could start an EC2 instance, install our program, run it,
                    send back the result, and then turn off the EC2 instance so somebody else could use it. There's a
                    lot of overhead in turning the computer on and installing our program, so we might want to leave it
                    on for a minute or two just in case the same user had some more input.</p>
                <p>AWS provides that capability, too. It's called Lambda.</p>
                <p>Because Lambda runs programs without a dedicated server, it's considered "serverless". To be clear,
                    there is a server involved; we're just not guaranteed anything about it except that it can run our
                    program. It might run on one physical computer the first time, and a completely different computer
                    the next time. A better name might have been "transient", but naming is hard, and "serverless"
                    sounds more awesome. The team running the service doesn't need to know anything about the servers
                    involved; Lambda takes care of it. And the team only pays for the time it actually spends running
                    its service. The waiting time between requests incurs no cost (unlike paying for an EC2 instance 24
                    hours per day).</p>
                <p>To run a serverless program on demand, we must package it in a way Lambda understands, along with
                    instructions that tell Lambda what method to run and what resources the program accesses. AWS
                    provides a way to define all this information called the Serverless Application Model (SAM), along
                    with a sam tool that lets us run Lambda programs locally for testing.</p>
                <p>To make use of these benefits, the ShipmentService runs on Lambda, so you're going to get first-first
                    hand experience running a Lambda service!</p>

                <h2>Project Mastery Tasks</h2>
                <p>These tasks are assigned in the appropriate module of the Sprint.</p>
                <p>Unlike other units, not all Mastery Tasks apply to the Unit Project here in Unit 3. Mastery Tasks 1
                    and 2 provide you with some experience and skills you may use when appropriate in this and
                    subsequent units. Therefore the running, testing and grading of Mastery Tasks 1 and 2 are different
                    that for the rest of the unit.</p>
                <p>Here is a summary of the Mastery Tasks and where they will be assigned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mastery Task 1: That Cloud Looks Like a Log - Sprint 1, Module 1 - Logging to the Cloud</li>
                    <li>Mastery Task 2: Testing the Waters - Sprint 1, Module 2 - Overview of Remote Debugging</li>
                    <li>Mastery Task 3: Time is Marching On - Sprint 1, Module 4 - Inheritance and Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Mastery Task 4: Time is Still Marching On - Sprint 2, Module 3 - Maps</li>
                    <li>Mastery Task 5: The Cost of Progress - Sprint 2, Module 3 - Designing with Composition</li>
                    <li>Mastery Task 6: I Fits, I Sits - Sprint 3, Module 1 - Exception Handling</li>
                    <li>Mastery Task 7: We Will Mock You - Sprint 3, Module 3 - Mocking</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Consideration</h3>
                <p>Because the Unit project is built incrementally through the Mastery Tasks, you may discover that
                    tests may not pass on your local machine, but do pass when you submit your code to CodeGrade. For
                    example, when you are working on Mastery Task 3, tests may run for Mastery Tasks 4 through 7 on your
                    local machine and fail since you have not yet completed those tasks. This is expected and OK. The
                    CodeGrade evaluation for each Sprint does not test for Mastery Task to be completed in future
                    Sprints. As long as you pass the tests for the Mastery Tasks assigned in the Sprint and the
                    CodeGrade evaluation for the Sprint passes you are good.</p>
