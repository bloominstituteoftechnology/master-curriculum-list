            <h2>Transitioning from Labs to Job Search</h2>
            <p>Now that you've completed your Labs project, it's time to leverage your experience to find a job in the
                tech industry.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Career Tip</h4>
                <p>Your Labs experience is a valuable portfolio piece! Be prepared to discuss:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The challenges you overcame</li>
                    <li>How you collaborated with your team</li>
                    <li>Technical decisions you made and why</li>
                    <li>What you would do differently next time</li>
                    <li>The impact of your contributions to the project</li>

            <h2>Introduction: Career Readiness in Labs</h2>
            <h3>Career Readiness in Labs</h3>
            <p>In this module, we'll walk through the process you'll follow in Labs to get your resume, LinkedIn
                profile, and GitHub profile fully career-ready by incorporating your Labs project. You'll also ensure
                your Learner Profile is up to date!</p>
            <p>Just like in Applied CS, you'll submit your Career Artifacts as part of this module. You'll prepare by
                reviewing the resources in this module and preparing your project information. Your Resume Reviewer will
                evaluate them and provide feedback as necessary.</p>
            <p>If one or more of them still needs work, you'll get targeted feedback on how to improve them, and you'll
                be able to resubmit them once you've made the required revisions.</p>
            <p>At that point, you'll also have the option to schedule a live, one-on-one review session. This session
                builds on the work you put in last unit‚Äîyour Resume Reviewer will work with you to incorporate your Labs
                project and finalize your artifacts before graduation.</p>
            <p>Regardless, though, if all your artifacts still aren't passing after two submissions, you'll be required
                to schedule a review session.</p>
            <h3>Launching Your Job Search</h3>
            <p>Since Labs is also officially the start of your job search, you'll find plenty of resources and
                instructions in the <code>Job Search</code> course in Canvas‚Äîbut for our purposes here, you'll need to
                source, apply to, and conduct outreach to at least five jobs to pass this course!</p>

            <h2>Outreach to 5 Jobs</h2>
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Draft and send 5 cold emails, tracking your outreach in Job Tracker.</p>

                <h3>Finding Contacts to Reach Out To</h3>
                <p>The goal of outreach is to make contact with your future employer.</p>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>In your outreach, you want to get as close as possible to your future team. Here's how to prioritize
                    people at the company you're applying to, and what tools to use.</p>

                <h4>‚ùóÔ∏èWho to prioritize in your outreach</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>#1 Your Future Boss:</strong> Your top priority in your outreach is to find your future
                        boss. Titles to look out for include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Engineering Manager</li>
                            <li>Data or UX Team Lead</li>
                            <li>Head of Engineering, Head of Data, Head of Design</li>
                            <li>Technical Team Lead</li>
                            <li>VP of Engineering</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>#2 Your Future Peer:</strong> If you can't find your future boss, your second priority
                        is to reach out to a future peer. Someone at the company who holds the same title as the one you
                        are applying to. ‚≠êÔ∏è Bonus points if they have a non-traditional pathway into tech or similar
                        background to you! ‚≠êÔ∏è
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>#3 a Non-Technical HR or People Team Member:</strong> If you can't find either of the
                        above, at the very least contact a technical recruiter or member of the People/HR team. These
                        people are great to contact in addition to the list above, but shouldn't be the only people you
                        contact unless you absolutely can't find anyone technical to reach out to.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>üß∞ Your tools</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>LinkedIn's in-site search tools</li>
                    <li>This Google search term to "Xray scan" LinkedIn: site:www.linkedin.com/in ‚Äúcompany name‚Äù ‚Äúrole‚Äù
                        "additional keywords, i.e city"</li>
                    <li>Lambda Job Tracker</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>‚è± Give yourself time to find the right contacts: up to 10 minutes per job</strong><br>
                        Finding the right people to contact is the most manual part of the application process but also
                        the most important. The more time you give yourself to find the right person, the more likely
                        you are to be flagged in the ATS (Applicant Tracking System).<br>
                        Reserve at least 10 minutes per job to find the right people to outreach to. This will get
                        faster as you practice, but make sure you block out enough time to find the right people to
                        contact.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>üìß Send 5 cold emails</strong><br>
                        Now that you're a Master of Outreach‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, send 5 cold emails using the techniques we've covered.
                        Just do it!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When you've sent 5 cold emails and tracked your outreach in Job Tracker, your progress will be
                    reflected here. It may take some time for the assignment to update.</p>

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Apply to 5 jobs and track them in Job Tracker</p>
                <h3>Submitting Quality Applications</h3>
                <p>Job searching is tiring! Especially when you don't hear back from companies.</p>
                <p>Some job seekers take a quantity approach to their search, submitting applications through
                    "one-click" or "easy apply"- you upload your resume and call it a day. The act of clicking submit
                    might feel productive in the moment, but days or weeks later this approach doesn't often produce the
                    desired result - an invitation to an interview. You might as well call this approach the application
                    or resume black hole.</p>
                <p>If you want a higher response rate on applications you need to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Submit a quality application, then‚Ä¶</li>
                    <li>Follow-up on that application by reaching out to a human</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>What makes an application a quality application?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Apply to a posting that has been live within the past 2 weeks.</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Apply directly through a company's website. </li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Have 50% (or more) of the requirements or preferred qualifications.</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Use a strong and relevant resume to apply.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Following Up on Quality Applications</h3>
                <p>Now that you know how to submit quality applications, time to deep dive into app follow-up. When you
                    submit an app your work isn't over! </p>
                <p>You need to try to get your app seen by a human so it doesn't languish <a

                        ATS</a>.</p>
                <p>‚û°Ô∏è Fast facts about follow-up: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow-up means contacting a person who works at the company you are applying to. You might hear
                        the Careers Team refer to this as "outreach" or "cold contacting" as well.</li>
                    <li>Lambda grads get the best results from follow-up emails. But you can also connect with someone
                        via a LinkedIn connection request + with an attached note, a LinkedIn InMail message, a Twitter
                        DM, etc.</li>
                    <li>Your top priority when you outreach is to your "future boss" or the technical stakeholder for
                        the role. If you can't find this person, find a "future peer" or someone who holds the same
                        title as you on the team. Bonus points if they have a similar pathway into tech. </li>
                    <li>The most important thing is that you make contact with an actual person involved with hiring for
                        the role you're applying for. Don't skip this step - outreach is unavoidable in a successful job
                        search! </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>üö´ The ATS is, sadly, not your friend. </h4>
                <p>To understand why we outreach, it's useful to understand exactly how an Applicant Tracking System
                    (ATS) works. When you apply to a role, your app lands in a database of many other names. Because no
                    one has time to review every single app submitted for a job <a
                        href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/you-only-get-6-seconds-of-fame-make-it-count"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(not even for the proverbial 7.4 seconds)</a> the
                    hiring
                    team needs to use the ATS to cut the list to a manageable size.</p>
                <p>Teams can filter on things like years of experience, location, or things that were listed as "nice to
                    haves" in the description. It actually doesn't really matter what a hiring team filters on, because
                    you simply can't customize your resume for every filter out there.</p>
                <h4>üìß Outreach is your friend! </h4>
                <p>Instead of customizing your resume for every possible filter a hiring team might use, it's more
                    efficient to use outreach to get yourself on the hiring team's radar. Don't wait for an ATS to
                    surface you, your outreach increases the chance someone will pull up your app.</p>
                <p>No matter where you are in the ATS, filtered out or not, they can search for your app. Outreach is an
                    important tool to advocate for yourself in the hiring process. Get around the ATS, and do your best
                    to ensure that the time you spent on your quality application doesn't go to waste. </p>
                <h4>ü§î What about my quality application?</h4>
                <p>You might be thinking ‚Äî hold on. I spent time on my application, submitted it through the company
                    site, applied within 24 hours of the role being posted, I'm a 50% match for what they are asking
                    for.</p>
                <p>Won't the team know my name by those steps alone?</p>
                <p>...maybe. Sometimes you'll get invited to interviews without outreach, especially when you're among
                    the first to apply. But in your job search, you want to operate on more than maybes! Outreach
                    increases the potential for someone to see your quality application.</p>
                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>Apply to 5 jobs, tracking their status in Job Tracker. Use our criteria for quality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è You meet at least half (50%) of the qualifications</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Job posting is less than 2 weeks old</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Applying directly to the company using their website</li>
                    <li>‚òëÔ∏è Use a resume that emphasizes keywords and skills needed for the job</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On the next page, you'll move on to implement the most critical step: sending an outreach note to a
                    talent or technical professional at each company.</p>
                <p>When you've applied to 5 jobs and tracked them in Job Tracker, your progress will be reflected here.
                    It may take some time for the assignment to update.</p>
