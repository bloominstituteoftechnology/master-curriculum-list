                <h2>Understanding Your First Ticket</h2>
                <p>This is the first Build Sprint of Labs. Now that you are locally setup, it's time to start work on your first ticket.</p>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <h4>First Ticket Details</h4>
                    <p>View your first ticket details and requirements on GitHub:</p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/BloomTech-Labs/BloomCodeCamp-be-a-starter/blob/main/tickets/firstTicket.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Ticket Documentation</a>

                    <p>Note: You should be working off a forked version of the starter repo.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Step-by-Step Workflow</h4>
                    <p>Here is the exact step-by-step workflow you should follow when you access your ticket above:</p>

                    <h5>1. Familiarize Yourself with the Repository</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Read the documentation thoroughly to understand the repository. This may include API contracts, READMEs, or docs on Google/Notion.</li>
                        <li>Check the README of the ticket you have been assigned to know what is expected of you.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>2. Understanding the Deliverable</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check the deployed version of the product to see the expected output and match it with what you have to build.</li>
                        <li>Read the example of the expected output provided in the README.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>3. Code Unit Test (if applicable)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a relevant test exists, follow the test-driven development approach to guide your development.</li>
                        <li>Validate your code using the unit test to ensure you've produced the expected outcome.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>4. Code the Component/Feature</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Code your deliverable, the feature described in the ticket.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>5. Record a Loom Video</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Demonstrate the feature in the video.</li>
                        <li>Provide a detailed explanation of your thought process while coding.</li>

                <h2>Submit your Sprint 1 Deliverables: Loom and Code</h2>

                <h3>Technical Interview Simulation</h3>

                <p>You're in the middle of your first technical interview. The interviewer is going through your resume and stops at the section describing your Labs project. They turn to you and ask:</p>

                <p>"How would you describe the project you built in BloomTech Labs and the contributions you had on it?"</p>

                <p>Using Loom, record a video articulating to a hiring manager the product you'll be working on in Labs. Feel free to reference your code and ticket.</p>

                <p>You should concisely answer the following questions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What were the deliverables for your ticket?</li>
                    <li>What requirements did you have to keep in mind? Think tech stack, constraints, etc.</li>
                    <li>How did you go about shipping your ticket?</li>
                    <li>Why did you take the approach you took?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The video should be no longer than 5 minutes, and you must demo the project in the video.</p>

                <h3>Submission Details</h3>

                <p>Submit the links to your Loom video and code on GitHub using the form below.</p>

                <a href="https://portal.bloomtech.com/instruction/sprint-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can access the submission form here.</a>

                <p>Note: If any one link is missing, the assignment will not be graded and you will have to resubmit.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>be on a forked version of the project repo.</li>
                    <li>meet all the requirements listed on the ticket in the README file for this build sprint.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>In your Loom video, you must:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>demo the code you created for this ticket.</li>
                    <li>articulate how you coded this ticket and why you took that approach.</li>
                    <li>showcase your workflow and what steps you took to code this ticket.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>All submissions will be graded based on criteria set forth in the rubric below.</p>

                    <h3>Standup Format</h3>
                    <p>In a standup meeting, each team member typically answers these three questions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>What did I accomplish yesterday?</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>What will I work on today?</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>What blockers or challenges am I facing?</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Keep your update concise and focused on these points. If detailed discussions are needed, they should be taken "offline" after the standup.</p>
