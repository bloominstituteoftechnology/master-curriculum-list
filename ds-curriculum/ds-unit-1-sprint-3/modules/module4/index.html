            <h2>Objective 01 - Understand and Define Bias</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Machine learning algorithms use mathematical or statistical models with inherent errors in two
                categories: reducible and irreducible error. Irreducible error, or inherent uncertainty, is due to
                natural variability within a system. In comparison, reducible error is more controllable and should be
                minimized to ensure higher accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bias and variance are components of reducible error. Reducing errors requires selecting models that have
                appropriate complexity and flexibility, as well as suitable training data. Data scientists must
                thoroughly understand the difference between bias and variance to reduce error and build accurate
                models.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bias is the calculated error due to systematic mistakes that lead to high or lower results when compared
                to the actual values. The individual residual of an estimate is the difference between that estimated
                and the actual value.
            </p>
            <p>
                In linear regression, <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#prediction-bias"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prediction bias</a> is “a value indicating how far apart
                the
                average of predictions is from the average of labels in the dataset.” In the majority of applications,
                prediction bias is not deliberately included as part of a model's design, but it is used as a measure to
                evaluate and tune the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                When estimates are biased, they are consistently incorrect in one direction due to mistakes in the
                model. An example could be a model that consistently predicts daily sales that are higher than those
                actually observed. The model is biased, as there is a mistake that gives too high an estimate. If this
                model were to be unbiased, there may still be days predicted that are not correct, but the incorrect
                sales amounts will sometimes be higher and sometimes lower than the observed sales.

            <h2>Objective 02 - Understand and Define Variance</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                In statistics, variance measures <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variability.asp"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">variability</a>
                from the average or mean. It is calculated by taking the differences between each number in the data set
                and the mean, then squaring the differences to make them positive, and finally dividing the sum of the
                squares by the number of values in the data set minus one.
            </p>
            <p><img src="../../assets/Screenshot_19-7-2025_214050_bloomtech.instructure.com.jpeg"
                    alt="sample_variance.svg"></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A high variance indicates that numbers in the set are far from the mean and far from each other.
                </li>
                <li>A small variance indicates the opposite.</li>
                <li>A variance value of zero indicates that all values within a set of numbers are identical.</li>
                <li>Every variance that isn't zero is a positive number.</li>
                <li>A variance cannot be negative. You can't have a negative value resulting from a square.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Higher variance may lead to more errors in values that the model has not seen yet. The model thus fails
                to generalize well to unseen data.
            </p>
            <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
            <p>
                As you can see, variance and bias are measured by looking at the error values observed and predicted
                values. To properly tune our model, we must determine a balance between the rate of bias and variance in
                our results.

            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>
                One goal of predictive modeling is to find the optimal "sweet spot" in which we minimize our error.
                Ideally, we're trying to find the ideal balance of bias and variance that allows our models to properly
                generalize to its testing or new values.

            <p>
                This requires us to modify our model to increase or decrease complexity to find a model that generalizes
                well on its training and testing dataset.

            <h2>Objective 04 - Define Different Types of Biases</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Bias is the purposeful or unintentional selection of one class or outcome, over other groups or outcomes
                in a dataset. This occurs when a model or data set is unrepresentative. This drawback in statistical
                analysis can be rectified in the data selection process as part of your EDA, data cleaning, or feature
                selection.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Bias</h3>
            <p>Some types of biases you may encounter include:</p>
            <h4>Selection Bias</h4>
            <p>
                Using groups, individuals, or data in a way that does not allow for proper randomization. This may
                result in a sample that is not representative of a population.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Polling only individuals who have access to a landline telephone in 2012. This
                demographic may not be wholly representative of all voters in the United States.
            </p>
            <h4>Survivorship Bias</h4>
            <p>
                Where interpreting the results from individuals who have 'survived' a long process are included or
                excluded.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> From <a

                “We enroll for gym membership and attend for a few days. We see the same faces of many people who are
                fit, motivated and exercising everyday whenever we go to gym. After a few days we become depressed why
                we aren't able to stick to our schedule and motivation more than a week when most of the people who we
                saw at gym could. What we didn't see was that many of the people who had enrolled for gym membership had
                also stopped turning up for gym just after a week and we didn't see them.”
            </p>
            <p>
                During World War II, <a
                    href="https://www.cantorsparadise.com/survivorship-bias-and-the-mathematician-who-helped-win-wwii-356b174defa6"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abraham Wald</a> took survivorship bias into his
                calculations when
                considering how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire
            </p>
            <p><img src="../../assets/Mod-4-1.png" alt="Mod-4-1.png"></p>
            <h4>Recency Bias</h4>
            <p>
                When preference for the most recent event is favored over historic events.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                The final lawyer's closing argument a jury hears before being dismissed to deliberate.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many others you will have to deal with from your datasets. It is important to use the proper
                language when describing the results of your models given the sample you have chosen to use from a
                population.
