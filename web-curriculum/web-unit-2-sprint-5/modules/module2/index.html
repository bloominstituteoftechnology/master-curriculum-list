            <h1>Module 2: Events in the Browser</h1>
            <p>In this module, you'll learn about event handling in the browser. Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser which the system can detect and respond to. You'll understand different types of events, how to add event listeners, and how events propagate through the DOM, allowing you to create interactive web applications.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Understanding Event Types</h2>
                <p>Learn about different types of events that can occur in the browser and how to handle them. Events include user interactions (clicks, keyboard input), browser actions (page load, resize), and more. Understanding these event types is crucial for creating responsive interfaces.</p>

                    <iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ibfctjj28k" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" loading="lazy"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-details">
                    <h3>What Are Events?</h3>
                    <p>Every user interaction with a site is an event: a click, moving the mouse, scrolling the page, pressing a key on the keyboard, these are all events on the page, and the browser can detect all of them. There are tons of different events the browser tracks. When an event happens on a page, it is known as a trigger.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript's real power lies in its ability to make web pages interactive. In addition to manipulating elements, JavaScript also allows us to add features and modify our site by directly reacting to user interactions.</p>
                    <p>Some common types of events include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mouse events</strong>: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, mouseover, mouseout</li>
                        <li><strong>Keyboard events</strong>: keydown, keyup, keypress</li>
                        <li><strong>Form events</strong>: submit, change, focus, blur</li>
                        <li><strong>Document/Window events</strong>: load, resize, scroll, unload</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now that we know what an event is and we know the browser is constantly tracking them, we need to listen for specific events on specific elements. For example, did a user click that button? Did a user's mouse hover over an element? Was there text entered into the input field?</p>

            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Handling Events with HTML Attributes</h2>
                <p>Learn how to handle events using HTML attributes and inline event handlers. This is one of the simplest approaches to event handling, where you directly add event attributes like onclick, onmouseover, or onsubmit to HTML elements with JavaScript code as their values.</p>
                <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/6mbyxyxh7y" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" loading="lazy"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-details">
                    <h3>Inline Event Handlers</h3>
                    <p>The simplest way to handle events is by using HTML attributes that start with "on" followed by the event name. This approach directly embeds JavaScript code as attribute values.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre><code>&lt;button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>You can also call functions defined elsewhere:</p>
                    <pre><code>&lt;button onclick="handleClick()"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  function handleClick() {
    console.log('Button was clicked');
    // More functionality here
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>While this approach is simple, it has some limitations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mixes HTML structure with behavior, which can make code harder to maintain</li>
                        <li>Only allows for one handler per event on an element</li>
                        <li>Limited access to the event object</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This method is considered somewhat outdated, but it's important to understand as you'll encounter it in existing code.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Handling Events with addEventListener</h2>
                <p>Master the use of addEventListener for handling events in JavaScript. This is the modern, preferred approach to event handling that allows for multiple event listeners on a single element, better separation of concerns, and greater flexibility with event options like capturing and once.</p>
                <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/md91pir870" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" loading="lazy"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-details">
                    <h3>The Event Listener Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The tracking process and subsequent action taken when an event occurs is called an event listener. We put an event listener on an element and give it a callback. When that event is triggered on the element, the callback is run.</p>
                    <p>The modern way to handle events is using the <code>addEventListener</code> method, which has the following syntax:</p>
                    <pre><code>element.addEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction, options);</code></pre>
                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>eventType</strong>: A string specifying the event type (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover')</li>
                        <li><strong>callbackFunction</strong>: The function to execute when the event occurs</li>
                        <li><strong>options</strong>: An optional object with additional settings</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre><code>const button = document.querySelector('button');

button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
  console.log('Event object:', event);
});</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>
