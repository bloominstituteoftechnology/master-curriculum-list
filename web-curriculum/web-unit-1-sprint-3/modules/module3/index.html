        <h2>Destructuring Assignment</h2>

        <p>Now that you are comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals, you will learn how to destructure, or break apart,
          objects and arrays to extract specific values and create shallow copies of them. Not only does destructuring
          save time and keystrokes, but it also makes your code easier to read! Destructuring allows you to make changes
          to an object or array without modifying the original data.</p>

        <p>Let's say you are building an e-commerce website, and you have an array of products, where each product is an
          object with properties like name, description, price, and availability. To display the list of products on the
          homepage, you may need to extract only specific properties, such as the name and price, to show in a product
          grid. You can easily access the name and price properties from each product object in the array by using the
          destructuring assignment. Similarly, you may need to extract specific elements from an array if you have
          different colors of a single product to display the options for a customer to choose from during the checkout
          process.</p>

        <p>By the end of this core competency, you will be equipped with the skills to work with complex data structures
          effectively, making you more efficient and confident as a software engineer. Ready? Let's get started!</p>

        <h3>Destructuring assignment with objects</h3>

        <p>Destructuring an object in JavaScript is a way to access one or more values from an object and assign them to
          variables in a single statement. At some point in your programs, you will want to extract some properties into
          their own variables with the same name. Thinking back to dot notation from object properties, you can use dot
          notation to access each value, but that can get repetitive.</p>

        <p>Let's revisit accessing properties within an object without destructuring:</p>

        <pre><code>
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5 }; 

let a = obj.a;
let b = obj.b;
let d = obj.d; 
                </code></pre>

        <p>To destructure an object, you will list the declaration (<code>let</code> or <code></code>) and the property
          names you want to extract between curly braces <code>{}</code> on the left-hand side of the assignment
          operator. On the right side of the assignment operator, you will use the name of the object that contains the
          properties you'd like to access.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of a destructured object:</p>

        <pre><code>
let { a, b, d } = obj; //destructuring the 'a', 'b', and 'd' properties from the obj object 
console.log(a, b, d); // prints 1 2 4
                </code></pre>

        <p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: The syntax on the left of the assignment operator is not an actual object, it just
          mimics its shape. This is called the destructuring binding pattern. You can reference more in-depth
          information about destructuring patterns here.</p>

        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>

          <p>Your team Lead is building out the new charting app. To develop this further, you need to destructure the
            patient objects to only show the information needed on the top of the medical chart, which is the name,
            birthday, allergies, and diagnosis.</p>

          <p>You can destructure an object like this:</p>

          <pre><code>
let patient = {name: 'Jordan Fisherman', birthday: 'April 7, 1994', age: 29, allergies: ['gluten', 'penicillin'], diagnosis: 'Type 2 Diabetes', insurance: 'none', medicineLogs: [{medicine_name: 'Prednisone', dose: '20mg', time: '9pm'}]};

let {name, birthday, allergies, diagnosis} = patient;

console.log(name, birthday, allergies); // prints 'Jordan Fisher', 'April 7, 1994', ['gluten', 'penicillin']
                </code></pre>

          <p>The team can now show relevant information needed for the patient with less load time. This is a huge help
            for your senior developer who will be optimizing the logs on the medical chart. Great job!</p>

          <div class="video-container">
            <iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/air8mn5nqo" title="Destructuring Assignment with Objects"
              allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy"></iframe>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Destructuring an array is similar to destructuring an object. You may also need to extract some elements into
          their own variables. Thinking back to square bracket notation from accessing array elements, you can use the
          square bracket notation to access the array elements, but it can also get repetitive. Let's revisit accessing
          elements within an array without destructuring:</p>

        <pre><code>
let arr = [1, 2, 3]; // we have an array

let first = arr[0];
let second = arr[1];
                </code></pre>

        <p>To destructure an array, you will use a declaration, then the element names you want to extract between
          square brackets <code>[]</code> (not <code>{}</code>) on the left side of the assignment operator. On the
          right side, you will use the name of the array that contains the elements you'd like to access. Here is an
          example of a destructured array:</p>

        <pre><code>
let [first, second] = arr; 
console.log(first, second); // prints 1 2                   
                </code></pre>

        <p>The syntax on the left of the equals is not an actual array, it just mimics its shape like its object
          counterpart.</p>

        <p>Destructuring also provides a shorter way to swap the values of two variables, like this:</p>

        <pre><code>
let [x, y] = [1, 2]; // declaring and assigning x and y
console.log(x, y); // prints 1 2
[x, y] = [y, x]; // performing the swap
console.log(x, y); // prints 2 1
                </code></pre>

        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>

          <p>The new charting app your team has been working on at Rowanda Regional Medical Center has reduced load
            times by 30 percent! The team would now like to optimize the medicine logs on the patient charts to increase
            efficiency. Your task is to destructure the medicine logs array like this:</p>
          <p>Our patient at the medical center has quite a few medications he needs, so here is only a portion of the
            logs:</p>

          <pre><code>
let patient = {name: 'Jordan Fisher', birthday: 'April 7, 1994', age: 29, allergies: ['gluten', 'penicillin'], diagnosis: 'Type 2 Diabetes', insurance: 'none', medicineLogs: [
  {medicine_name: 'Prednisone', dose: '20mg', time: '9pm'},
  {medicine_name: 'Loratadine', dose: '10mg', time: '9pm'}, 
  {medicine_name: 'Omeprazole', dose: '40mg', time: '10pm'}
]};
                </code></pre>

          <p>Since we already have the patient's info at the top of the chart, we only need the medicine name, dose, and
            time the medicine was given. We will use what we know so far to destructure the log like this:</p>

          <pre><code>
let [first, second, third] = patient.medicineLogs; //gives us each object set to a variable name

console.log(first, second, third); // prints each medicine log object
                </code></pre>

          <p>The nurses can now see the medicine logs much easier. This is super helpful because some of the patient's
            medications are very strict on how far apart each dose should be taken. Your senior developer is able to
            submit this feature for final review by the end of the day. Awesome work!</p>

          <div class="video-container">
            <iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/soj5intasd" title="Destructuring Assignment with Arrays"
              allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy"></iframe>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>You can also use destructuring assignment with function invocations. You may also need to extract some values
          that are returned in functions into their own variables. You can use the same destructured object or array
          syntax from return values in functions, but which you use depends on the type of data. Let's explore some
          examples together!</p>

        <p>Here is a function that returns a person object:</p>

        <pre><code>
function person() {
  return { name: 'Joe', age: 45 };
}
let { name, age } = person(); // pulling name and age props from the value of the invocation
console.log(name, age); // prints 'Joe' 45
                </code></pre>

        <p>Here is a function that returns a fruits array:</p>

        <pre><code>
function fruits() {
  return ['apple', 'orange', 'pineapple'];
}
let [first, second] = fruits(); // pulling the first couple of elements from the value of the invocation
console.log(first, second); // prints 'apple' 'orange'
                </code></pre>

        <p>If a function invocation returns an array or object, we can use destructuring with the invocation on the
          right of the assignment operator.</p>

        <p>Pro Tip: You will see this later on in the program when you start learning React. Make sure to practice to
          get comfortable with destructuring!</p>

        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>

          <p>Now that your senior developer has submitted the medical chat for final review, your team lead would like
            you to begin working on destructuring a function's return value to make the patient intake process more
            efficient. This function takes in the patient's name, birthday, any allergies, and if they have insurance as
            parameters.</p>

          <p>You can destructure a return value like this:</p>

          <pre><code>
function patientIntake(name, birthday, allergies, insurance) {
return {name: name, birthday: birthday, allergies: allergies, insurance: insurance};
}

let { name, birthday, allergies, insurance } = patientIntake('Miranda Lynn', 'August 14, 1967', 'none', 'Employer Insurance'); //destructured values from the returned object you receive from invoking the function

console.log(name, birthday, allergies, insurance); // prints 'Miranda Lynn' 'August 14, 1967' 'none' 'Employer Insurance'                    
                </code></pre>

          <p>The nurses at the hospital can now see the patient's information populate into the medical chart faster
            because of your hard work. This can be a life-saving feature. Your senior developer and team lead will be
            very pleased with this. You are doing a fantastic job!</p>

        <h3>Creating shallow copies of arrays and objects</h3>

        <p>You will run into situations throughout your career where you need to manipulate an array while also
          referencing the original array. This can be easily handled by copying the array using the spread operator. The
          spread operator, put simply, is <code>...</code> followed by what you'd like to shallow copy. Here is the
          spread operator in action:</p>

        <pre><code>
function addNumberSeven(arr) {
  const shallowCopy = [...arr]; // "spreading" all the elements in arr into a new array
  shallowCopy.push(7);
  return shallowCopy;
}

const nums = [1, 2, 3];

const numsAndSeven = addNumberSeven(nums);

console.log(numsAndSeven);// prints [1, 2, 3, 7]

console.log(nums); // prints [1, 2, 3]                     
                </code></pre>

        <p>In this example, you want to add the number 7 to the nums array without directly changing the array. The
          function <code>addNumberSeven</code> creates a shallow copy of the array by using the spread operator on the
          <code>arr</code> parameter <code>[...arr]</code> setting that to a variable. Because of this, any array that
          is passed into this function is created into a shallow copy. The data is safe!
        </p>

        <p>Note: These copies are called "shallow" because if the array contains arrays or objects, you are not creating
          copies of those.</p>

        <p>The spread operator can be used to create shallow copies of objects as well. In this example, we are going to
          use an object within another object:</p>

        <pre><code>
 // example of copying an object using the spread operator

const fruit = { name: 'apple' };

const meals = { snack: fruit };

const mealsCopy = { ...meals };

fruit.name = 'banana';

console.log(meals); // prints { snack: { name: 'banana' } }
console.log(mealsCopy) // prints { snack: { name: 'banana' } }                    
                </code></pre>

        <p>There is another way of creating shallow copies of objects, which is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1); // {} is the "target" onto which the props of obj1 are copied                    
                </code></pre>

        <p>Pro Tip: One of the main principles of software engineering is to maintain data integrity, which means that
          the data should be accurate, consistent, and complete. It is crucial to not directly change data because it
          violates this principle and causes errors that can be difficult to debug.</p>

        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>

          <p>Time for your last shift at Rowanda Regional Medical Center! Your Team Lead would like you to assist with
            creating a program that can copy patient medications so the hospital's research team can test potential
            treatment plans without any unwanted side effects. You can make a shallow copy of a patient's medications
            like this:</p>

          <pre><code>
let medications = [escitalopram, loratadine, gabapentin, melatonin];

function addMedication(arr) {
  const treatments = [amoxicillin, omeprazole, ibuprofen, tylenol];
  let medsCopy = [...arr]; // "spreading" all the elements in arr into a new array
  medsCopy.push(treatments[1]);
  return medsCopy;
}

console.log(addMedication(medications)); //prints [escitalopram, loratadine, gabapentin, melatonin, amoxicillin]

console.log(medications); // prints  [escitalopram, loratadine, gabapentin, melatonin]                    
                </code></pre>

          <p>The research team can now test each potential medication for any interference before treating the patient!
            With this more efficient process, the hospital hopes to see a shorter wait time for patients to be treated.
            Your senior developer and team lead are proud of your amazing progress with the biomedical team. Congrats on
            completing this case study!</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Excellent work completing this core competency on destructuring assignments! As you have explored this core
          competency, you have learned how destructuring saves time, keystrokes, and repetition within programs. You
          should be confidently destructuring from objects, arrays, and return values of functions. You also discovered
          how to create shallow copies of arrays and objects. We recommend that you keep practicing destructuring
          assignments because as you continue on your software developer journey, destructuring values will become
          another essential part of your workflow on the job.</p>

        <h2>The Ternary Operator</h2>

        <p>One popular shorthand operation is the ternary operator. The ternary operator takes the code of an if-else
          statement and squashes it into one line. If-statements are still helpful and can manage complexity far better
          than ternaries. Still, with more straightforward scenarios, you'll rarely see an if-statement used where a
          ternary operator would work.</p>
        <p>Ternaries are popular among developers; you will often see them in your career. Developers like them because
          ternaries decrease the needed code and are often considered easier to read and write. It's worth your time to
          become familiar with ternaries so you understand them and speed up your development. Read on and see what
          ternaries can do for you.</p>

        <h3>Using the ternary operator</h3>

        <p>A ternary expression is a shorthand way of writing an if statement with only two possible outcomes. It takes
          the form of <code>condition ? value if truthy : value if falsey</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>
let age = 20;
let message = age >= 18 ? “You are an adult”: “You are not an adult”;                    
                </code></pre>

        <p>The first part of the ternary (<code>age >= 18</code>) is the condition followed by a question mark, as if
          it's presenting the question in code. The second part is the value returned if the condition is truthy, and
          the third is if it's falsy. The above example reads, “if the age variable is greater than or equal to 18, the
          message variable will be set to 'You are an adult'. Otherwise, it will be set to 'You are not an adult'.”</p>

        <p>Ternary expressions are best used for conditions that have only two possible outcomes. If statements, on the
          other hand, are better suited for more complex conditions with multiple outcomes. However, this is not a
          hard-and-fast rule. The choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific situation and the
          programmer's preference.</p>

        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>

          <p>The website's designer wants a button on the top right corner of the page that allows users to either login
            or logout based on the user's login status. A variable holding the user's login state already exists on all
            pages (isUserLoggedIn). If they are logged out, the designers want the button to say “Login”. Otherwise, it
            should say “Logout”.</p>

          <pre><code>
let isUserLoggedIn = false

// get the button element from the HTML. The button has the id “login-button”
const button = document.querySelector('#login-button');

// update the text of the button based on if the user is logged in
button.textContent = isUserLoggedIn ? 'Logout': 'Login';                    
                </code></pre>

          <p>This code is clear and succinct! If you changed the button text using an if-statement, the code would be
            longer and not add any extra value. You could argue that an if-statement makes the code less readable.</p>

          <pre><code>
let isUserLoggedIn = false
const button = document.querySelector('#login-button');
if (isUserLoggedIn) {
    button.textContent = 'Logout'
} else {
    button.textContent = 'Login'
}                    
                </code></pre>

          <p>The designers have a second request. When the user hits the button, you need to perform two actions: call
            the appropriate function (login() or logout()) and update the button's text. Could a ternary be used here?
            Not easily. An if-statement would work better because you perform multiple actions in at least one of the
            branches. Let's see what that might look like.</p>

          <pre><code>
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  if (isUserLoggedIn) {
    logout()
    button.textContent = 'Login'
  } else {
    login()
    button.textContent = 'Logout'
});                    
                </code></pre>

          <p>When to use ternary operators is up to you, but your co-workers are impressed with the readability of your
            code and hope to see more of this clean coding style in the future.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Ternary operators are useful shorthand tools that are easy to read and write. They can eliminate many lines
          of unnecessary code and let you focus on the task rather than verbose syntax. Remember them as you write code,
          and you will see how valuable ternaries can be. And don't worry about finding opportunities to use them; you
          will have plenty of chances to use ternaries here at BloomTech and throughout your career.</p>

        <h2>Asynchronous Code</h2>

        <p>Welcome to the world of asynchronous programming! This is a major step in your coding journey. Web
          applications are typically asynchronous, meaning the program is not supposed to be executed sequentially or in
          a deterministic fashion. Instead, pieces of code are triggered according to events such as user interaction or
          timers. In fact, JavaScript has been conceived from the ground up to facilitate asynchronous programming.
          Understanding how asynchronous code works - types of events, event listeners and out-of-order execution - is a
          fundamental skill that will enable you to design real-world applications. You will now learn how to use timers
          and browser events to trigger functions in your program (often called “callback functions” or “event
          handlers”).</p>

        <h3>Asynchronous code using timeouts</h3>

        <p>The <code>setTimeout</code> function is the simplest intro to async programming, and yet very popular amongst
          developers. The concept is straightforward: a particular block of code is scheduled to be executed later
          rather than now. This is commonly done to implement a delay before displaying a message to the user, but there
          are many possible use cases for a timer.</p>

        <pre><code>
// the "future" code is always packaged, or "wrapped" in a function
function delayedCode() { 
  console.log('delayed code');
}

console.log('foo');

// the first argument is the function declared previously, the second is a delay in milliseconds
setTimeout(delayedCode, 10); 
console.log('bar');

/* the order of prints to the console is:
foo
bar
delayed code */                    
                </code></pre>

        <p>Once the delay is done, the JavaScript engine calls the function passed as the first argument. But the other
          two log statements happen sequentially (synchronously). We can also "inline" the function containing the
          "future" code, like in this next example:</p>

        <pre><code>
console.log('fizz');
// the future code, in this case the log statement, is wrapped in an anonymous function
setTimeout(() => console.log('delayed code'), 1); 
console.log('buzz');

/* the order of prints to the console is:

fizz
buzz
delayed code */                    
                </code></pre>

        <p>To put it in perspective, 1ms is usually a LOT of time in terms of engine execution, surely enough or two
          <code>console.log</code> executions.
        </p>

          <h3>How to Build It</h3>

          <p>The Perereka club would like to offer more services to its members. By incorporating a web server in the
            setup, the club will be able to gather real time weather and traffic data from the Internet every 30
            minutes, and broadcast the message to all users. This is how the code would look like:
          </p>

          <pre><code>
// 1800000 ms = 30 min
setTimeout(broadcastUpdates, 1800000);

function broadcastUpdates() {
    // This will check if there's anyone currently using the frequency, and delay the broadcast for another 2 minutes (120 seconds, or 120000 milliseconds)
    if (isFrequencyBusy()) {
        setTimeout(broadcastUpdates, 120000);
        return; //nothing else to do now, exit the function
    }

    // Function to create the audio file from the updated weather and traffic data
    const updates = createAudioFrom("latest_report.txt");
    // Function to broadcast the message. In practice, this will output the computer's audio into the transmitter located at the repeater tower
    transmitAudio(updates);
    // Let's no forget about the smartphone users connected to the website
    streamAudio(updates);
    // Now we are ready to reschedule (30 minutes)
    setTimeout(broadcastUpdates, 1800000);
}                   
                </code></pre>

          <p>The first <code>setTimeout</code> needs to be called in the “main” code body, otherwise the first run will
            never be scheduled. But notice how we are rescheduling the callback from within the same function! That's
            because once the callback is executed, it will never run again until you “register” it into a new
            <code>setTimeout</code>. In other words, <code>setTimeout</code> is a “run-once” trigger.
          </p>

          <p>In certain cases, you might want to schedule a function to run periodically, with a constant delay between
            runs, and regardless of external conditions. JavaScript offers you the <code>setInterval</code> function,
            exactly for that purpose:</p>

          <pre><code>
setInterval(() => {
  console.log("beat")
}, 1000);                    
                </code></pre>

          <p>By the way, the callback function can be declared anywhere in the code since its position is not related to
            the order of execution.</p>

          <p>When an async function runs, it takes full control over the execution engine. That implies that no other
            code will be triggered until the current one is finished. If the code executing is too long or slow, the
            application will be “blocked.” A good design pattern is to try and keep the callbacks as simple and short as
            possible. For more complex scenarios, advanced techniques in JavaScript - such as async, await and promises
            - enable you to create “concurrent” non-blocking execution.</p>

          <p>Let's move on! The <code>setTimeout</code> function is an example of an event listener. It is particularly
            “listening” for the timer to say “Go!”. In the next Learning Objective, you will learn how to use other
            types of event listeners, which will “listen” to user actions such as “I clicked!”.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Asynchronous code using browser events</h3>

        <p>The browser interface often requires the user to click on buttons or input text that will be processed by the
          application. This is a typical asynchronous scenario where we don't know when the user will interact with the
          browser. The <code>setTimeout</code> function is not going to work here. Instead, we need a way to trigger
          code after a particular user interaction happens in the webpage. Just like we did with the setTimeout
          listener, we will set up browser event listeners to trigger our functions:</p>

        <pre><code>
window.onclick = () => console.log('Ha! You clicked'); 
// if you click repeatedly on the browser window you'll see 'Ha! You clicked' printing each time                   
                </code></pre>

        <p>JavaScript programs are more of an orchestration of "future" reactions to certain events than a series of
          synchronous actions. This is because users "will act when they act," not right when the program starts on page
          load. Here are some other examples of browser events that can trigger callbacks: mouse over a particular page
          element, text copied to the clipboard, specific key typed on the keyboard, and display entered the fullscreen
          mode.</p>

        <div class="note-box">
          <h3>How to Build It</h3>

          <p>A member of the radio club wants to connect to Perereka's web application through her smartphone (phone's
            browser) to participate in a conversation. It would be great if all the user had to do was press a button
            and start talking.</p>

          <p>This is how the code would look:</p>

          <pre><code>
setTimeout(broadcastUpdates, 1800000);
function broadcastUpdates() {
 // This will check if there's anyone currently using the frequency, and delay the broadcast for another 2 minutes (120 seconds, or 120000 milliseconds)
 if (frequencyBusy()) {
   setTimeout(broadcastUpdates, 120000);
   return;
 }
 // Function to access the city's API and get the data in JSON format
 getCityData();
 // Function to create the audio file from the text received
 createAudio("updates.mp3");
 // Function to broadcast the message. In practice, this will output the audio into the transmitter mic and trigger the PTT (push to talk).
 transmitAudio("updates.mp3");
 // Now we are ready to re-schedule for 30 minutes!
 setTimeout(broadcastUpdates, 1800000);
}
talkButton.ontouchstart = startTalk;
talkButton.ontouchend = finishTalk;
// Assume that this object (talkButton) has been created somewhere else in the code, and that it represents a button in the user interface.
// Just like you can add an event listener to the window object, we can add the previous two event listeners to the button object.
// They will monitor touch events triggered by the user's touchscreen on a cell phone!
function startTalk() {
 // This will check if there's anyone currently using the frequency, and avoid the pile-up.
 if (frequencyBusy()) {
   return;
 }
 //Might add code here to change the button color to red!
 // Function to broadcast the message. In practice, this will stream the phone's mic to the web server, which will in turn output the audio into the transmitter mic and trigger the PTT (push to talk).
 startStreaming();
}
function finishTalk() {
 //Might add code here to change the button color to gray!
 stopStreaming();
}                    
                </code></pre>

          <pre><code>
function startTalk() {
 
// This will check if there's anyone currently using the frequency, and avoid the pile-up.
 if (frequencyBusy()) {
   return;
 }
 //Might add code here to change the button color to red!
 // Function to broadcast the message. In practice, this will stream the phone's mic to the web server, which will in turn output the audio into the transmitter mic and trigger the PTT (push to talk).
 startStreaming();
}function finishTalk() {
 //Might add code here to change the button color to gray!
 stopStreaming();
}                    
                </code></pre>

          <p>In this last example, we are using two different events and two corresponding callback functions. The event
            listeners (touchstart and touchend) are associated with the same page element <code>talkButton</code>. You
            will learn how to create page elements later in the course.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>By using timers and other types of events, you will be able to design very powerful async web applications!
          While traditional synchronous code has little use to web applications, it is in fact easier to write, read and
          debug, as compared to async code. If this is your first experience with async programming, it might take you
          some time to develop a new mindset. Keep practicing! Experiment with multiple <code>setTimeouts</code> and
          callbacks. And if you feel adventurous, see what happens when you call other sync and async functions from
          inside a callback. Remember that console.log is your best friend to learn and debug.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>The link below takes you to Bloom's code repository of the assignment. You'll need to fork the repo to your
          own GitHub account, and clone it down to your computer:</p>
        <p>Starter Repo: <a href="https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/W_S3M3_Project" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript in the Wild</a></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Fork the repository, and then use the green button and your terminal to clone the project down to your
            computer.</li>
          <li>Next, open the <code>index.html</code> file in both VSCode and the Chrome Browser. VSCode is where you
            will make code changes, and Chrome is where you will check if your code is passing all the tests.</li>
          <li>To check the tests, right-click on a Chrome window, select "Inspect," and ensure the console is visible.
            Then return to VSCode and start coding a solution to the first challenge. When you want to check if your
            code is correct, go to Chrome and refresh the page to run the tests and see your results.</li>
