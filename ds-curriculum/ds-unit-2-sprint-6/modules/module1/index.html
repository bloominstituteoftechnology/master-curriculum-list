            <h2>Module Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this module, you will learn about decision trees, one of the most
                intuitive and widely used machine learning algorithms. Decision trees
                are versatile models that can be used for both classification and
                regression tasks, making them essential tools in a data scientist's
                toolkit.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll explore how decision trees work, from the basic concepts of
                node splitting to practical implementation using scikit-learn. You'll
                also learn about the strengths and limitations of decision trees,
                setting the foundation for more advanced tree-based methods in later
                modules.

            <h2>Objective 01 - clean data with outliers and missing values</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Cleaning data is an important task when we are beginning any machine learning or data science project.
                Real-world data is often messy, with missing values, outliers, incorrect values, and many other issues.
                In this objective we're going to focus on two of the more common problems: outliers and missing values.
            </p>
            <p>
                An outlier is a data point that is different from the rest of your data set in some way. It can be the
                result of an error, corrupted data, or a true value that just happens to be different from the rest.
                When dealing with outliers we first need to identify them and then remove or adjust them. It's important
                to do this because model training and performance can be affected by outliers, especially if you don't
                know what type or how many are present in your data.
            </p>
            <h3>Identifying Outliers</h3>
            <p>
                There are a number of different methods used to identify outliers. In this objective we're not going to
                go into great detail because these methods depend on the type of data you are working with and also the
                type of model(s) you are trying to fit. There are however a few basic methods that generally apply when
                detecting outliers. One of the most common is to perform a statistical analysis to identify data points
                that are statistically different from the rest. For example, you might assume your data is normally
                distributed and look for values that are a certain distance from the mean. Extreme values are easy to
                find and filter out this way if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another method is to just look at the data. This is something you have likely already done - visualizing
                your data is an important first step. Depending on the type of data you are working with, a scatter plot
                or histogram are useful tools to help identify outliers. Some types of plots, such as boxplots, are also
                a great way to visualize the descriptive statistics of a data set.
            </p>
            <h3>Handling Outliers</h3>
            <p>
                Once you identify outliers, you need to decide what to do with them. If you don't have a big data set,
                taking away even just a few data points could affect your model results. Also, some outliers are
                actually real data and might need to be included in your analysis. However, there are times where the
                outliers need to be removed, or at least be transformed into a different value.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a large data set and you identify extreme values using statistical methods, it's probably
                safe to just remove them. If you want or need to keep as much data as possible, you could also transform
                the outliers. A common method is to apply a log transform where you take the logarithm of an outlier to
                reduce its effect on analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outliers aren't the only problem we encounter with real-world data. Often the outliers could be missing
                values that were replaced with a zero or some other value. Removing or changing these values is
                important if we want our analysis and models to accurately represent our data.
            </p>
            <h3>Missing Values</h3>
            <p>
                It would be rare to find a data set that doesn't have missing values. Because there are different ways
                to handle missing values, sometimes we end up with <code>NaN</code> values, but other times there could
                be a <code>0</code> or a <code>999</code> or even some random string. It's also important to figure out
                why there is a missing value. Is it
                because the data wasn't recorded or is it because it didn't make sense to put a value there? For
                example, a survey might ask for the age of the youngest child in the house. If a household doesn't have
                any children, this value might be left empty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Missing values can be handled in different ways depending on why they are missing. The above example
                would be suitable for replacing with <code>NaN</code>. But what if there is a row of data, where the
                column "number of children" is non-zero but the age of the youngest is missing? This data
                could have been
                recorded but wasn't.
                Working with missing data and determining what to do with it will require you to actually look at your
                data and to read any associated documentation. The more important your project, the more closely you
                will want to look at the missing values.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next section, we'll look at a practice data set and identify some outliers and missing values and
                work through a few examples of how to handle them.
            </p>
            <h3>Follow Along</h3>
            <p>
                We're going to make use of another data set available in the seaborn library. The "planets" data is from
                the <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA exoplanet catalog</a> and contains information
                like the planet's distance from Earth, the planet's mass, and discovery date. This data set contains
                missing values so it will provide us with a good practice set. We can also use this data to check for
                outliers or extreme data points that we might not want to include in our analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll start by loading the data, looking at the descriptive statistics, and making some plots.

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                For this challenge, you can choose to explore a dataset you are already somewhat familiar with. Check
                for missing values, think about what you should do with them, and then make some plots to help identify
                outliers.
