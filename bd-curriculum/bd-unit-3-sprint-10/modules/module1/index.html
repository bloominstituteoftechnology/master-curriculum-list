            <div class="content-box">
                <p>In Java, a Set is a data structure that stores a unique collection of objects. Each object in a Set occurs once and only once. This is unlike a List or array where you can store the same object in multiple positions. Another difference between Sets and Lists or arrays is that a Set does not necessarily store or return objects in any particular order. For Lists, the typical use case is to retrieve individual elements based on an index. For Sets, however, the more common use cases are to check for an element's existence and to operate on a set of unique values.</p>
                <p>In this reading, we will explore the essential methods defined by the Set interface, look into one of the Set implementations called HashSet, and compare it to Java arrays and Lists.</p>

                <h2>What is a set?</h2>
                <p>Imagine you work for Amazon Fresh, and you need to track what fruit the business offers. Suppose you use an ArrayList to store each entry. Your list might look like this:</p>
                <pre><code>["banana", "grapes", "fig", "mango", "pear", "apple", "peach", "watermelon"]</code></pre>
                <p>To check if Amazon Fresh sells grapes, you would have to look at each item until you find grapes or until you reach the end of the list and find out you don't sell grapes. Not so bad if we are looking for grapes, but this would be slower for watermelon, which is at the end of the list. As our fruit catalog gets bigger, this operation will get even slower! The time complexity of searching for fruit in an ArrayList has linear time complexity, O(n). However, we have learned that if you know the index to look up a value in an ArrayList, accessing it is a constant time, O(1), operation. We can determine if a specific fruit is in our catalog in constant time, O(1), if we use a HashSet, which implements the Set interface.</p>
                <p>A HashSet is a data structure that utilizes the concept of hash codes to assign locations of objects to allow for a constant time, O(1), lookup. A hash function is used to determine where to store and retrieve items.</p>
                <p>A hash function might produce the following hash codes:</p>
                <pre><code>"banana" → 4
"grapes" → 1
"fig" → 3
"mango" → 7
"pear" → 5
"apple" → 5
"peach" → 8
"watermelon" → 6</code></pre>
                <p>Using the hash codes as the storage location results in the following storage:</p>
                <pre><code>Index	Value
0	&lt;empty&gt;
1	Collection { "grapes" }
2	&lt;empty&gt;
3	Collection { "fig" }
4	Collection { "banana" }
5	Collection { "apple", "pear" }
6	Collection { "watermelon" }
7	Collection { "mango" }
8	Collection { "peach" }
9	&lt;empty&gt;
...etc...</code></pre>
                <p>Notice the items are not stored in any particular order like they were above in the ArrayList. The elements are ordered by their hash code. This is why Sets do not guarantee any order.</p>
                <p>In Java, Set is an interface, which means we cannot instantiate a Set. HashSet is one implementation of the Set interface. There are others, but we will not focus on any others in this lesson.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In this reading, we will demonstrate how HashSet accomplishes constant time, O(1), operations. We will build our mental model around this by assuming HashSet uses an array as its underlying storage. The Java implementation of HashSet may utilize a different way of storing its elements but the process for where to store and retrieve them will hold true!</p>

                <h2>HashSet</h2>
                <p>Declaring a HashSet looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">Set&lt;E&gt; hashSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();</code></pre>
                <p>We use the interface type on the left-hand side, declaring E as the generic type. E is a placeholder for the Java class type your Set will store. We've named the set <code>hashSet</code>. On the right-hand side of the equals sign, we call the no-args HashSet constructor.</p>
                <p>For our Amazon Fresh example, our HashSet declaration looks like the following:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">Set&lt;FreshFruit&gt; fruitsOffered = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();</code></pre>
                <p>We will declare our <code>FreshFruit</code> class to be:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">public class FreshFruit {
    
    private String name;
    private boolean isSeedless;

    public FreshFruit (String name, boolean isSeedless) {
         this.name = name;
         this.isSeedless = isSeedless;
    }
    
   @Override
   public boolean equals(Object o) {
        // An object can't be equal to null.
        if (o == null) {
            return false;
        }

        // If two objects have the same reference, they should be equal.
        if (this == o) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // If the objects are of different types, they shouldn't be equal. 
        if (getClass() != o.getClass()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Now that we know they are of the same type, cast the object to a FreshFruit
        FreshFruit that = (FreshFruit) o;
        
        // Finally, implement the checks for equality between attributes that make the two objects equal.
        return Objects.equals(this.name, that.name) && Objects.equals(this.isSeedless, that.isSeedless);
   }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(this.name, this.isSeedless);
    }
}</code></pre>
                <p>When using a HashSet, it's important to remember that there is no guarantee to the order of the elements in the Set. The order that you add elements to the Set has no impact on how they are stored, unlike an ArrayList that always adds to the end of the list. Instead, elements are stored based on their hash code value. So, if you iterate through the elements of a Set, they will not be in any specific order. In fact, after the Set has been modified and changed sizes, another iteration through the Set could return a completely different ordering.</p>
                <p>Now that we know how to create a HashSet, let's dive into some commonly used methods. For a complete list, you can check out the <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HashSet Javadoc</a>.</p>

                <h3>The add() method</h3>
                <p>The <code>add()</code> method allows us to add elements to a Set. If the element is not contained in the Set it will be added, and the method will return true. If the element is already included in the Set the element will not be added, and the method will return false.</p>
                <p>For example, we want to add a pear to our Amazon Fresh catalog:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">FreshFruit pear = new FreshFruit("pear", false);
boolean isAdded = fruitsOffered.add(pear);</code></pre>
                <p>Let's discuss in more detail how the pear is being added and stored. It will be stored at the array index that corresponds to the hash code value of the pear object, as shown in Figure 1. In this case, the <code>add()</code> method calls the FreshFruit <code>hashCode()</code> method to get the hash code for pear. Let's say it returns 1. We add pear and return true.</p>
                <p>This whole process takes on average constant time, O(1)! Regardless of how big our Set is, we still only need to execute the <code>hashCode()</code> method to determine the storage location of the element.</p>
                <p><em>Figure 1</em></p>
                <p><em>Figure 1. A diagram that shows three indexes of our storage array: 0, 1, and 2. The pear element is stored in index 1. The add() method returns true.</em></p>
                <p>Since pear is the first element added to <code>fruitsOffered</code>, we know that the index it's added to is empty, but that's not always the case. The storage array has a limited number of indexes, meaning that some elements are hashed to the same location. Let's add an apple to <code>fruitsOffered</code>:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">FreshFruit apple = new FreshFruit("apple", false);
boolean isAdded = fruitsOffered.add(apple);</code></pre>
                <p>The <code>add()</code> method calls the FreshFruit <code>hashCode()</code> method to get the hash code for apple. Let's say the <code>hashCode()</code> method returns 1. We go to store our apple in index 1, but there is something already there! Since the <code>add()</code> method does not allow duplicate elements to be added, we first have to check if the existing element equals the one being added. The FreshFruit's <code>equals()</code> method is used to see if the new element is a duplicate. In this case, pear is compared to apple and <code>equals()</code> returns false. We have ruled out that this is a duplicate item; instead, we have what we call a collision. Remember, we are storing a Collection in each index of our storage array to add our new element to the list stored at index 1. The apple and pear objects are now both stored in the same list at index 1, as shown in Figure 2. The <code>add()</code> method once again returns true.</p>
                <p><em>Figure 2</em></p>
                <p><em>Figure 2. A diagram that shows three indexes of our storage array: 0, 1, and 2. The pear element is stored in a Collection at index 1. The apple element is also stored in the Collection stored at index 1. The add() method returns true.</em></p>
                <p>Let's take a look at what happens when a duplicate is added:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">FreshFruit duplicateApple = new FreshFruit("apple", false);
boolean isAdded = fruitsOffered.add(duplicateApple);</code></pre>
                <p>The <code>add()</code> method calls the FreshFruit <code>hashCode()</code> method to get the hash code for duplicateApple. The <code>hashCode()</code> method returns 1. Remember: the <code>hashCode()</code> method should always return the same value for equal objects. <code>hashCode()</code> should always return 1 for any seeded apple; otherwise, we will have some trouble knowing about duplicates! Next, the <code>add()</code> method will check the contents of the Collection in index 1 to check for duplicates. The <code>equals()</code> method is used to make the comparisons. The <code>add()</code> method finds that the first element is equal to duplicateApple. The <code>add()</code> method will return without editing the contents of the Collection and return false. Our Set remains unchanged in Figure 3.</p>
                <p><em>Figure 3</em></p>
                <p><em>Figure 3. A diagram that shows three indexes of our storage array: 0, 1, and 2. The pear element is stored in a Collection at index 1. The apple element is also stored in the Collection stored at index 1. The add() method returns false.</em></p>

                <h3>The contains() method</h3>
                <p>The <code>contains()</code> method allows us to check if a particular element is present in a Set. If the element is contained in the Set the method will return true. If the element is not included in the Set the method will return false.</p>
                <p>We can use the following line of code to check if an apple is present in our Set:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">FreshFruit appleCheck = new FreshFruit("apple", false);
boolean isPresent = fruitsOffered.contains(appleCheck);</code></pre>
                <p>The <code>contains()</code> method also utilizes the <code>hashCode()</code> method. The element's hash code is used to find out which index in the array storage to look for the element. Each element in the cell's Collection is inspected to see if it is the element the caller is looking for. The <code>equals()</code> method is used to compare the given element and the element in the Collection. If a match is found, true is returned. If none of the elements match, then the <code>contains()</code> method knows the given element doesn't exist in the Set and returns false.</p>
                <p>For example, let's say our <code>fruitsOffered</code> currently looks like Figure 4.</p>
                <p><em>Figure 4</em></p>
                <p><em>Figure 4. A diagram that shows three indexes of our storage array: 0, 1, and 2. The pear element is stored in a Collection at index 1. The apple element is also stored in the Collection stored at index 1.</em></p>
                <p>Let's walk through what happens when we execute the following line of code:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">fruitsOffered.contains(appleCheck);</code></pre>
                <p>The <code>contains()</code> method calls the FreshFruit <code>hashCode()</code> method to get the hash code for <code>appleCheck</code>. The <code>hashCode()</code> method returns 1. The FreshFruit <code>equals()</code> method is used to compare the given element, <code>appleCheck</code>, with the first element in index 1, pear. They are not equal. The second element is checked, <code>appleCheck</code> = apple, and so a match is found and true is returned.</p>
                <p>We say that HashSet's <code>contains()</code> method is also, on average, a constant time, O(1), operation. We need to call the <code>hashCode()</code> method to find the storage location of an element directly. The <code>hashCode()</code> operation will consistently take the same amount of time, regardless of the size of our Set. However, we just saw that once we get to the storage index, we may need to inspect a few entries to determine which value to return. When two objects map to the same location, we call this a collision. The worst-case scenario is when a <code>hashCode()</code> method maps ALL objects to the same place. This means we would have to look through every element on a call to <code>contains()</code>, making it take linear time, O(n). This is an easy to avoid worst-case though. Collisions can be minimized when the element's <code>hashCode()</code> method does an excellent job of providing unique hash codes for unique objects, and we have a large enough storage array to spread the elements across. As an engineer, you are responsible for writing the <code>hashCode()</code> method in classes that you write. At ATA, we recommend using the <code>Objects.hash()</code> method to implement your <code>hashCode()</code> method effectively. It does a great job at spreading hash codes across all the possible int values! The Java implementation of HashSet is smart and will resize the Set to ensure there are enough storage indexes to minimize collisions. This will result in an average constant runtime, O(1).</p>

                <h3>The remove() method</h3>
                <p>The <code>remove()</code> method allows us to remove a particular element from a Set if it is present. If the element is contained in the Set the method will return true. If the element is not included in the Set the method will return false.</p>
                <p>We would use the following line of code to remove the apple element:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">FreshFruit anotherApple = new FreshFruit("apple", false);
boolean wasRemoved = fruitsOffered.remove(anotherApple);</code></pre>
                <p>The above code functions very similarly to the <code>contains()</code> method, but in addition to returning whether the element is present, it will also delete it from the Set. Let's say <code>fruitsOffered</code> looks as it does above in Figure 4. The element is located in the same manner as above, but now the element is removed from the cell. The updated <code>fruitsOffered</code> is shown in Figure 5.</p>
                <p><em>Figure 5</em></p>
                <p><em>Figure 5. A diagram that shows three indexes of our storage array: 0, 1, and 2. After a call to remove an apple, the apple element is removed from index 1, and the method returns true.</em></p>
                <p>Like <code>contains()</code>, <code>remove()</code> is also on average, a constant time, O(1), operation.</p>

                <h3>Searching for an element in a Set by an attribute</h3>
                <p>If we need to check if a Set contains an element that matches a specific attribute, and not on all the attributes that make two objects equal we can, but we won't be able to utilize our constant time lookup.</p>
                <p>If we wanted to know if we have any grapes in our Amazon Fresh catalog, seeds or no seeds, we could no longer use the <code>contains()</code> method. HashSet doesn't offer a way to search by some partial hash code value. Instead, we can utilize linear search, which has an O(n) runtime, by iterating through our Set.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">public boolean containsGrapes(Set&lt;FreshFruit&gt; fruitsOffered) {
    for (FreshFruit fruit : fruitsOffered) {
        if (fruit.getName().equals("grapes")) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}</code></pre>
                <p>Sets provide a way to maintain a unique collection of elements. HashSet offers constant time, O(1), operations for adding, removing, and checking its contents for the existence of an element.</p>
