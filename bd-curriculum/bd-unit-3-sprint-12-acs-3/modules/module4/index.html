                <h3>AWS Lambda</h3>
                <h4>What is an AWS Lambda function?</h4>
                <p>AWS Lambda is a server-less computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS
                    Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and
                    runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible
                    manner. Therefore you don't need to worry about which AWS resources to launch, or how will you
                    manage them. Instead, you need to put the code on Lambda, and it runs.</p>

                <h4>How does AWS Lambda work?</h4>
                <p>While using AWS Lambda you will realize that one does not get much visibility into how the system
                    operates. However, we will try to learn on a high level what happens underneath. Each Lambda
                    function runs in its own container. When a function is created, Lambda packages it into a new
                    container and then executes that container. Before the functions start running, each function's
                    container is allocated its necessary RAM and CPU capacity. Once the functions finish running, the
                    RAM allocated at the beginning is multiplied by the amount of time the function spent running. The
                    customers then get charged based on the allocated memory and the amount of run time the function
                    took to complete. One of the distinctive architectural properties of AWS Lambda is that many
                    instances of the same function, or of different functions from the same AWS account, can be executed
                    concurrently. Moreover, the concurrency can vary according to the time of day or the day of the
                    week, and such variation makes no difference to Lambda—you only get charged for the compute your
                    functions use. This makes AWS Lambda a good fit for deploying highly scalable cloud computing
                    solutions.</p>

                <h4>Advantages of AWS Lambda</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pay per use:</strong> You pay only for the compute your functions use, plus any network
                        traffic generated. For workloads that scale significantly according to time of day, this type of
                        billing is generally more cost-effective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fully managed infrastructure:</strong> Now that your functions run on the managed AWS
                        infrastructure, you don't need to think about the underlying servers—AWS takes care of this for
                        you. This can result in significant savings on operational tasks such as upgrading the operating
                        system or managing the network layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic scaling:</strong> AWS Lambda creates the instances of your function as they
                        are requested.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Tight integration with other AWS products. AWS Lambda integrates
                        with services like DynamoDB, S3 and API Gateway, allowing you to build functionally complete
                        applications within your Lambda functions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Limitations of AWS Lambda</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cold Start:</strong> When a function is started in response to an event, there may be a
                        small amount of latency between the event and when the function runs. If your function hasn't
                        been used in the last 15 minutes, the latency can be as high as 5-10 seconds, making it hard to
                        rely on Lambda for latency-critical applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Execution time limit:</strong> Execution time/run time. A Lambda function will time out
                        after running for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code package size limit:</strong> The zipped Lambda code package should not exceed 50MB
                        in size, and the unzipped version shouldn't be larger than 250MB.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Common use cases</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data processing:</strong> Lambda functions are optimized for event-based data
                        processing. It is easy to integrate AWS Lambda with datasources like Amazon DynamoDB and trigger
                        a Lambda function for specific kinds of data events. For example, you could employ Lambda to do
                        some work every time an item in DynamoDB is created or updated, thus making it a good fit for
                        things like notifications, counters and analytics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real time processing:</strong> Lambda functions can be used you to perform real-time
                        file processing and real-time stream processing considering it's server-less nature.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>AWS Lambda functions in JAVA</h4>
                <p>Lambda provides runtimes for Java that run your code to process events, hence making it possible to
                    run Java code in AWS Lambda</p>

                <p>The Lambda function handler is the method in your function code that processes events. When your
                    function is invoked, Lambda runs the handler method. When the handler exits or returns a response,
                    it becomes available to handle another event. There are there are 3 ways of creating a handler in
                    Java:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a custom MethodHandler</li>
                    <li>Implementing the RequestHandler interface</li>
                    <li>Implementing the RequestStreamHandler interface</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Based on the choice of creating the handler, the handler needs to be defined in the AWS Lambda
                    configuration in the format:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>package.Class::method - Full format</li>
                    <li>package.Class - Abbreviated format for functions that implement a handler interface. For
                        example: example.Handler</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>AWS API Gateway</h4>
                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed AWS service that makes it easy for developers to create,
                    publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for
                    applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API
                    Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication
                    applications. API Gateway supports containerized and server-less workloads, as well as web
                    applications.</p>

                <h5>AWS Lambda with API Gateway</h5>
                <p>AWS API Gateway allows to make AWS Lambda functions as an endpoint. This allows the request sent to
                    the API Gateway to be directed to Lambda function for processing. The API Gateway also allows to
                    send extra information in form of header, method type and request body which allows Lambda functions
                    to support method types like POST, GET and others.</p>

                <p>This Guided Project aims to give you a bigger picture of how AWS Lambda is used while also reviewing
                    the fundamentals of how to set up an AWS Lambda function. You will hear references to API Gateway
                    and DynamoDB - two concepts covered in later sprints. Since this Guided Project uses features you
                    will learn later, no starter code is given, and there's no need to follow along with the code.
                    Instead, do your best to gain insights into what is coming while reviewing how to set up AWS Lambda.
