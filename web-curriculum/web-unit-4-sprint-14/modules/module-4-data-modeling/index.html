                <h2>Data Normalization</h2>
                <p>Normalization is the process of designing or refactoring database tables for maximum consistency and
                    minimum redundancy.</p>

                <p>With objects, we're used to denormalized data, stored with ease of use and speed in mind.
                    Non-normalized tables are considered ineffective in relational databases.</p>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <h3>How to Build It</h3>
                    <p>Data normalization is a deep topic in database design. To begin thinking about it, we'll explore
                        a few basic guidelines and some data examples that violate these rules.</p>

                    <h4>Normalization Guidelines</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each record has a primary key</li>
                        <li>No fields are repeated</li>
                        <li>All fields relate directly to the key data</li>
                        <li>Each field entry contains a single data point</li>
                        <li>There are no redundant entries</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Denormalized Data</h4>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>farm_name</td>
                            <td>animal1</td>
                            <td>animal2</td>
                            <td>animal3</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                            <td>pigs</td>
                            <td>chickens</td>
                            <td>goats</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Morton Farms</td>
                            <td>horses</td>
                            <td>chickens</td>
                            <td>cows</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>This table has two issues. There is no proper id field (as multiple farms may have the same name)
                        and multiple fields are representing the same type of data: animals.</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>farm_id</td>
                            <td>farm_name</td>
                            <td>animals</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1</td>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                            <td>pigs, chickens, goats</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>2</td>
                            <td>Morton Farms</td>
                            <td>horses, chickens, cows</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>While we have now eliminated the first two issues, we now have multiple entries in one field,
                        separated by commas. This isn't good either, as it's another example of denormalization. There
                        is no "array" data type in a relational database, so each field must contain only one data
                        point.</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>animal_id</td>
                            <td>animal</td>
                            <td>farm_name</td>
                            <td>ann_revenue</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1</td>
                            <td>pig</td>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                            <td>65000</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>2</td>
                            <td>chicken</td>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                            <td>65000</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>3</td>
                            <td>goat</td>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                            <td>65000</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>Now we've solved the multiple fields issue, but we created repeating data (the farm field), which
                        is also an example of denormalization. We can also see that if we were tracking additional ranch
                        information (such as annual revenue), that field is only vaguely related to the animal
                        information.</p>

                    <p>When these issues begin arising in your schema design, it means that you should separate
                        information into two or more tables.</p>

                    <h4>Anomalies</h4>
                    <p>Obeying the above guidelines prevent anomalies in your database when inserting, updating, or
                        deleting. For example, imagine if the revenue of Beech Ranch changed. With our denormalized
                        schema, it may get updated in some records but not others:</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>animal_id</td>
                            <td>animal</td>
                            <td>farm_name</td>
                            <td>ann_revenue</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1</td>
                            <td>pig</td>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                            <td>45000</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>2</td>
                            <td>chicken</td>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                            <td>65000</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>3</td>
                            <td>goat</td>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                            <td>65000</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>Similarly, if Beech Ranch shut down, there would be three (if not more) records that needed to be
                        deleted to remove a single farm.</p>

                    <p>Thus a denormalized table opens the door for contradictory, confusing, and unusable data.</p>

                <h2>Table Relationships</h2>
                <p>There are three types of relationships:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>One to one</li>
                    <li>One to many</li>
                    <li>Many to many</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Determining how data is related can provide guidelines for table representation and guide the use of
                    foreign keys to connect said tables.</p>
                <div class="note-box">
                    <h3>How to Build It</h3>
                    <h3>One to One Relationships</h3>
                    <p>Imagine we are storing the financial projections for a series of farms.</p>

                    <p>We may wish to attach fields like farm name, address, description, projected revenue, and
                        projected expenses. We could divide these fields into two categories: information related to the
                        farm directly (name, address, description) and information related to the financial projections
                        (revenue, expenses).</p>

                    <p>We would say that farms and projections have a one-to-one relationship. This is to say that every
                        farm has exactly one projection, and every project corresponds to exactly one farm.</p>

                    <p>This data can be represented in two tables: farms and projections</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>id</td>
                            <td>farm_name</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1</td>
                            <td>Beech Ranch</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>2</td>
                            <td>Morton Farms</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>id</td>
                            <td>farm_id</td>
                            <td>revenue</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1</td>
                            <td>1</td>
                            <td>65000</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>2</td>
                            <td>2</td>
                            <td>105000</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>The farm_id is the foreign key that links farms and projections together.</p>

                    <p>Notes about one-to-one relationships:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The foreign key should always have a unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries. In the
                            example above, we wouldn't want to allow multiple projections records for one farm.</li>
                        <li>The foreign key can be in either table. For example, we may have had a projection_id in the
                            farms table instead. A good rule of thumb is to put the foreign key in whichever table is
                            more auxiliary to the other.</li>
                        <li>You can represent one-to-one data in a single table without creating anomalies. However, it
                            is sometimes prudent to use two tables as shown above to keep separate concerns in separate
                            tables</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>One to Many Relationships</h3>
                    <p>Now imagine, we are storing the full-time ranchers employed at each farm. Each rancher would only
                        work at one farm however, each farm may have multiple ranchers.</p>

                    <p>This is called a one-to-many relationship.</p>

                    <p>This is the most common type of relationship between entities. Some other examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One customer can have many orders.</li>
                        <li>One user can have many posts.</li>
                        <li>One post can have many comments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Manage this type of relationship by adding a foreign key on the "many" table of the relationship
                        that points to the primary key on the "one" table. Consider the farms and ranchers tables.</p>

                    <p>In a many-to-many relationship, the foreign key (in this case farm_id) should not be unique.</p>

                    <h3>Many to Many Relationships</h3>
                    <p>If we want to track animals on a farm as well, we must explore the many-to-many relationship. A
                        farm has multiple animals, and multiple types of animals are present at multiple different
                        farms.</p>

                    <p>Some other examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>an order can have many products and the same product will appear in many orders.</li>
                        <li>a book can have more than one author, and an author can write more than one book.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We need to introduce an intermediary table that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key
                        on the related tables to model this relationship. We now have a farms, animals, and farm_animals
                        table.</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>id</td>

                    <p>While each foreign key on the intermediary table is not unique, the combinations of keys should
                        be unique.</p>

                <h2>Create Table Relationships Using Knex</h2>
                <p>The Knex query builder library also allows us to create multi-table schemas that include foreign
                    keys. However, when designing a multi-table schema, there are a few extra things to keep in mind,
                    such as using the correct order when creating tables, dropping tables, seeding data, and removing
                    data.</p>

                <p>We have to consider the way that delete and updates through our API will impact related data.</p>
                <div class="note-box">
                    <h3>How to Build It</h3>
                    <h4>Foreign Key Setup</h4>
                    <p>In Knex, foreign key restrictions don't automatically work. Whenever using foreign keys in your
                        schema, add the following code to your knexfile. This will prevent users from entering bad data
                        into a foreign key column.</p>

                    <pre><code>development: {
  client: 'sqlite3',
  useNullAsDefault: true,
  connection: {
    filename: './data/database.db3',
  },
  // needed when using foreign keys
  pool: {
    afterCreate: (conn, done) => {
      // runs after a connection is made to the sqlite engine
      conn.run('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON', done); // turn on FK enforcement
    },
  },
},</code></pre>

                    <h4>Migrations</h4>
                    <p>Let's look at how we might track our farms and ranchers using Knex. In our migration file's up
                        function, we would want to create two tables:</p>

                    <pre><code>exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {
  return knex.schema
    .createTable('farms', tbl => {
      tbl.increments();
      tbl.string('farm_name', 128)
        .notNullable();
    })
    // we can chain together createTable
    .createTable('ranchers', tbl => {
      tbl.increments();
      tbl.string('rancher_name', 128);
      tbl.integer('farm_id')
        // forces integer to be positive
        .unsigned()
        .notNullable()
        .references('id')
        // this table must exist already
        .inTable('farms')
    })
};</code></pre>

                    <p>Note that the foreign key can only be created after the reference table.</p>

                    <p>In the down function, the opposite is true. We always want to drop a table with a foreign key
                        before dropping the table it references.</p>

                    <pre><code>exports.down = function(knex, Promise) {
  // drop in the opposite order
  return knex.schema
    .dropTableIfExists('ranchers')
    .dropTableIfExists('farms')
};</code></pre>

                    <p>In the case of a many-to-many relationship, the syntax for creating an intermediary table is
                        identical, except for one additional piece. We need a way to make sure our combination of
                        foreign keys is unique.</p>

                    <pre><code>.createTable('farm_animals', tbl => {
  tbl.integer('farm_id')
    .unsigned()
    .notNullable()
    .references('id')
    // this table must exist already
    .inTable('farms')
  tbl.integer('animal_id')
    .unsigned()
    .notNullable()
    .references('id')
    // this table must exist already
    .inTable('animals')

  // the combination of the two keys becomes our primary key
  // will enforce unique combinations of ids
  tbl.primary(['farm_id', 'animal_id']);
});</code></pre>

                    <h4>Seeds</h4>
                    <p>Order is also a concern when seeding. We want to create seeds in the same order we created our
                        tables. In other words, don't create a seed with a foreign key until that reference record
                        exists.</p>

                    <p>In our example, make sure to write the 01-farms seed file and then the 02-ranchers seed file.</p>

                    <p>However, we run into a problem with truncating our seeds, because we want to truncate 02-ranchers
                        before 01-farms. A library called knex-cleaner provides an easy solution for us.</p>

                    <p>Run knex seed:make 00-cleanup and npm install knex-cleaner. Inside the cleanup seed, use the
                        following code.</p>

                    <pre><code>const cleaner = require('knex-cleaner');

exports.seed = function(knex) {
  return cleaner.clean(knex, {
    mode: 'truncate', // resets ids
    ignoreTables: ['knex_migrations', 'knex_migrations_lock'], // don't empty migration tables
  });
};</code></pre>

                    <p>This removes all tables (excluding the two tables that track migrations) in the correct order
                        before any seed files run.</p>

                    <h4>Cascading</h4>
                    <p>If a user attempt to delete a record that is referenced by another record (such as attempting to
                        delete Morton Ranch when entries in our ranchers table reference that record), by default, the
                        database will block the action. The same thing can happen when updating a record when a foreign
                        key reference.</p>

                    <p>If we want that to override this default, we can delete or update with cascade. With cascade,
                        deleting a record also deletes all referencing records, we can set that up in our schema.</p>

                    <pre><code>.createTable('ranchers', tbl => {
    tbl.increments();
    tbl.string('rancher_name', 128);
    tbl.integer('farm_id')
    .unsigned()
    .notNullable()
    .references('id')
    .inTable('farms')
    .onUpdate('CASCADE');
    .onDelete('CASCADE')
})</code></pre>
