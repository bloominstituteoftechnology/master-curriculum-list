                <p>An immutable class is one whose state cannot be changed after instantiation. Here are the key steps
                    to create an immutable class:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Declare the class as <code>final</code> to prevent extension</li>
                    <li>Make all fields private and final</li>
                    <li>Don't provide setter methods</li>
                    <li>If the class contains mutable objects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make defensive copies in the constructor</li>
                            <li>Make defensive copies in the getter methods</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensure that methods don't modify the object's state</li>
                </ol>

                <pre><code>public final class ImmutablePerson {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;
    private final List&lt;String&gt; hobbies;
    
    public ImmutablePerson(String name, int age, List&lt;String&gt; hobbies) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        // Defensive copy to prevent the reference from being modified externally
        this.hobbies = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(hobbies);
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
    
    public List&lt;String&gt; getHobbies() {
        // Return a defensive copy to prevent modification
        return new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(hobbies);
    }
}</code></pre>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In the Encapsulation lesson, we covered declaring variables (both instance variables and method
                    parameters) and classes final. We also discussed the effects of these declarations and the
                    motivations for using them. These declarations are part of the building blocks needed to create an
                    immutable class where both the state and behavior are unchangeable. This reading will discuss the
                    other steps needed to create an immutable class so you can create a custom one whenever you want.
                </p>

                <h2>Immutable objects</h2>
                <p>We've already used many immutable classes from the Java library, like primitives and wrapper classes,
                    but what made them immutable? The term means not capable or susceptible to change. In Java, this
                    takes on a more precise definition. Constructors of immutable classes make immutable objects, and
                    once they do, the state of the object becomes fixed. In addition, we want the method behavior to be
                    fixed, which is why it is important to prevent overriding the methods through subclassing.</p>

                <h2>Creating an immutable class</h2>
                <p>In order to create an immutable class, we'll need to apply the final keyword as discussed from
                    Reading 01 in the right places. We may also get a chance to utilize defensive copying which we
                    learned about in our Encapsulation lesson.</p>

                <p>The steps to create an immutable class are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Declare the class final to prevent sub-classing. This prevents the overriding of methods.</li>
                    <li>Declare the instance variables final to prevent them from being reassigned.</li>
                    <li>Do not provide setter methods for instance variables.</li>
                    <li>Ensure the instance variables' states can't change once initialized. While there's no simple
                        declaration for this, there are several ways to accomplish it:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Primary method: Use immutable types where possible, and let Java do the work for you.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you can't follow the primary method, it's a little more complicated:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ensure your class never provides references to instance variables by utilizing
                                        defensive copying. Defensive copying provides access to an object's information
                                        by copying it and providing a reference to the copy. We'll show an example of
                                        this further down.</li>
                                    <li>Ensure the class' methods never change the state of its instance variables.
                                        There's no way to ensure this outside of careful programming and testing.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Imagine you have written an immutable CustomerOrder class using the steps described above. In Figure
                    1, we have created an immutable object of type CustomerOrder, which is indicated by the bold box.
                    The object's state and behavior are fixed at instantiation. In Figure 1, note that order is not
                    declared final, so its value could be changed to point to a different CustomerOrder object. If you
                    also decided to declare the variable order final, the effect would make both the reference and
                    object immutable.</p>

                <p>Figure 1: Creating a custom immutable class called CustomerOrder.</p>

                <h2>Immutable class design example</h2>
                <p>Figure 2 shows the class diagram for the CustomerOrder class we introduced above. The instance
                    variables of type long, String, and BigDecimal are all immutable. However, the variable orderDate is
                    a mutable Date.</p>

                <p>The methods include a constructor where we initialize all the instance variables, a getter for
                    customerID, another getter for orderDate (the mutable Date), and a method computeBill() that takes a
                    taxRate and calculates the total. We'll ignore shipping costs and other complications in this
                    example.</p>

                <h2>Immutable class implementation</h2>
                <p>Figure 3 shows an implementation of the CustomerOrder class. Below are some key specifics to
                    highlight.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The CustomerOrder class is declared final.</li>
                    <li>All the instance variables are declared private and final. Each is initialized in the
                        constructor. The orderDate is initialized by defensively copying the Date provided in the
                        constructor. The orderDate field is assigned a new instance of a Date object using the time
                        field from the passed Date object.</li>
                    <li>In the method getOrderDate(), defensive copying is used to create a new instance of a Date
                        object using the time field from the original Date object. The original Date reference is never
                        exposed.</li>
                    <li>The customerID, name, and orderAmount instance variables are immutable. This means we don't need
                        to utilize defensive copying in the getter methods.</li>
                    <li>There are no setters in this class. The getters, except for orderDate, are omitted below.</li>
                    <li>At no point in this class are the instance variables themselves modified.</li>
                </ul>

                <pre><code>public final class CustomerOrder {
    private final long customerID;
    private final String name;
    private final BigDecimal orderAmount;
    private final Date orderDate;
    /**
     * Constructor.
     * @param customerID - Customer identifier
     * @param name - Customer full name
     * @param orderAmount - Dollar amount of order
     * @param orderDate - Day order was made
     */
    public CustomerOrder(long customerID, String name, BigDecimal orderAmount, Date orderDate) {
        this.customerID = customerID;
        this.name = name;
        this.orderAmount = orderAmount;
        this.orderDate = new Date(orderDate.getTime());
    }
    /**
     * returns immutable primitive.
     * @return customer identifier
     */
    public long getCustomerID() {
        return customerID;
    }
    // some simple getters omitted for immutable instance variable Objects
    /**
     * Returns the Order Date using defensive encapsulation, since Date is mutable.
     * @return a new instance of the orderDate;
     */
    public Date getOrderDate() {
        return new Date(orderDate.getTime());
    }
    /**
     * Compute the total cost of the order.
     * Since Double is immutable in Java, a new Double will be returned.
     * @param taxRate - the tax rate for the purchase
     * @return order cost
     */
    public BigDecimal computeBill(BigDecimal taxRate) {
        BigDecimal taxRatio = taxRate.add(new BigDecimal("1.0"));
        return orderAmount.multiply(taxRatio);
    }
}</code></pre>

                <h2>Immutable class advantages</h2>
                <p><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> You've been introduced to this concept in a previous lesson. The idea
                    is to protect your object instances from being modified by the outside world. In large software
                    systems, this prevents many types of undesired or unexpected behaviors when software is modified. It
                    also protects your objects from being modified by malicious third parties during execution.</p>

                <p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> There are less cases to design for and test if the object's state is
                    fixed. Trying to anticipate what outside influences (internal or external to your software system)
                    can do to your mutable objects can be complex and daunting.</p>

                <p><strong>Thread safety:</strong> You've been introduced to concurrency as well as some associated
                    benefits and risks with using it. It's important that an application performs the same way when one
                    thread or many threads are running and interacting with its objects. A key risk is multiple threads
                    manipulating the state of the same object. Since immutable objects prohibit manipulating state, they
                    prevent this risk. Immutable classes are an essential tool when writing concurrent code.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Understanding the Final Keyword</h2>

                <p>The <code>final</code> keyword in Java can be applied to variables, methods, and classes, with
                    different effects:</p>

                <h3>Final Variables</h3>
                <p>When applied to a variable, <code>final</code> means that the variable cannot be reassigned after
                    initialization:</p>

                <pre><code>// Final primitive variable
final int MAX_SIZE = 100;
// MAX_SIZE = 200; // This would cause a compilation error

// Final reference variable
final List&lt;String&gt; namesList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
// namesList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); // This would cause a compilation error
namesList.add("John"); // This is allowed - the object's state can be changed</code></pre>

                <p>Important distinction: for reference variables, <code>final</code> prevents reassignment of the
                    reference, but it doesn't make the referenced object immutable.</p>

                <h3>Final Methods</h3>
                <p>When applied to a method, <code>final</code> prevents the method from being overridden in subclasses:
                </p>

                <pre><code>public class Parent {
    final void cannotBeOverridden() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}

public class Child extends Parent {
    // This would cause a compilation error
    // void cannotBeOverridden() { } 
}</code></pre>

                <h3>Final Classes</h3>
                <p>When applied to a class, <code>final</code> prevents the class from being extended:</p>

                <pre><code>final class CannotBeExtended {
    // Class implementation
}

// This would cause a compilation error
// class Subclass extends CannotBeExtended { }</code></pre>
            </div>

                <h2>Benefits of Immutability</h2>

                <p>Immutability offers several advantages in software development:</p>

                <h3>Thread Safety</h3>
                <p>Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot be modified after creation.
                    This eliminates the need for synchronization when sharing these objects between threads.</p>

                <h3>Simplicity and Predictability</h3>
                <p>Since immutable objects cannot change, they are easier to reason about and less prone to bugs related
                    to unexpected state changes.</p>

                <h3>Hashcode Consistency</h3>
                <p>Immutable objects make excellent keys in HashMaps and elements in HashSets because their hashcode
                    will never change.</p>

                <h3>Failure Atomicity</h3>
                <p>Operations on immutable objects cannot leave them in an inconsistent state if they fail midway.</p>

                <pre><code>// Example of immutable objects' advantages
// Thread safety
ImmutablePerson person = new ImmutablePerson("Alice", 30, Arrays.asList("Reading", "Hiking"));
// Can be safely shared between threads without synchronization

// HashMap key consistency
Map&lt;ImmutablePerson, String&gt; personDetails = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
personDetails.put(person, "Employee");
// The person's hashcode won't change, so it can always be retrieved</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Common Immutable Classes in Java</h2>

                <p>Java provides several built-in immutable classes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>String:</strong> Once created, a String object cannot be modified</li>
                    <li><strong>Integer, Long, Double:</strong> All primitive wrappers are immutable</li>
                    <li><strong>BigInteger, BigDecimal:</strong> For arbitrary-precision arithmetic</li>
                    <li><strong>Collections.unmodifiableXXX:</strong> Creates unmodifiable views of collections</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>String Immutability</h3>
                <p>String's immutability is a classic example:</p>

                <pre><code>String name = "Alice";
String upperName = name.toUpperCase(); // Creates a new String object
System.out.println(name); // Still prints "Alice"
System.out.println(upperName); // Prints "ALICE"</code></pre>

                <h3>Unmodifiable Collections</h3>
                <p>Creating immutable collections with Java's Collections utility:</p>

                <pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; mutableList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
mutableList.add("One");
mutableList.add("Two");

List&lt;String&gt; immutableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(mutableList);
// immutableList.add("Three"); // This would throw UnsupportedOperationException

// But be careful - the backing collection can still be modified:
mutableList.add("Three"); // This affects immutableList too!

// For true immutability, copy the elements:
List&lt;String&gt; trulyImmutable = Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(mutableList));</code></pre>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Functional Programming and Immutability</h2>

                <p>Immutability is a core principle of functional programming. Java has introduced several
                    functional-style features that work well with immutable objects:</p>

                <h3>Stream API</h3>
                <p>Streams provide a functional approach to processing collections of data:</p>

                <pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
List&lt;String&gt; upperNames = names.stream()
                           .map(String::toUpperCase) // Creates new objects rather than modifying
                           .collect(Collectors.toList());</code></pre>

                <h3>Optional</h3>
                <p>Optional is an immutable container that may or may not contain a non-null value:</p>

                <pre><code>Optional&lt;String&gt; optional = Optional.of("value");
String result = optional.map(s -> s.toUpperCase())
                      .orElse("default");</code></pre>

                <h3>Record Classes (Java 16+)</h3>
                <p>Records provide a concise way to create immutable data classes:</p>

                <pre><code>public record Person(String name, int age, List&lt;String&gt; hobbies) {
    // Constructor to perform defensive copying
    public Person {
        hobbies = List.copyOf(hobbies); // Creates an immutable copy
    }
    
    // No need to define equals, hashCode, toString, or accessors - they're generated
}</code></pre>
            </div>
